## How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Oppo Find X7 Ultra?

When you are playing location-based games like Pokemon Go, you might need to simulate GPS movement to catch more Pokemon. To do this, you can use the GPS movement feature of Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). This feature allows you to simulate GPS movement between two or multiple spots on the map. Here's how you can do it:

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

### Part 1: Simulate Movement Along a Route (One-Stop Route)

You can set up a one-stop route when **mocking locations fake** with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This particular feature helps users to set up looping or round trips within a specific location. To perform the steps for simulating movement, look ahead for a better understanding:

Step 1Access One-Stop Route Function

Once you launch Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and connect your smartphone successfully, proceed to select the **One-Stop Route** function from the top-right section. The function is represented by the third icon from the left in the section. While you have already teleported to another location or are using your current location, you can tap anywhere on the map to set your destination location.

![activate one stop route mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Step 2Define Simulation Parameters

Enter a number to define how many times you want to go back and forth, and select whether you want a **Round trip** or a **Loop trip**. Drag the slider on the speed option to set how fast you want to walk. Proceed to click **Move Here** on the bottom to start the movement simulation.

![set parameters to simulate](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

Step 3Start Simulation Movement

The respective simulation starts, and you can see your position is moving on the map with the speed you set. If you wish to hold the simulation, click **Pause** or tap **Clear** to revert to your original state.

![start one stop simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

### Part 2: Simulate Movement Along a Route (Multi-Stop Route)

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve_I4YgjYno" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

You can try the multi-stop mode if you want to pass by multiple places along a route on the map. Learn how it is done when you are trying to **spoof location on Android/**iOS:

Step 1Start Multi-Stop Route and Set Parameters

Activate the **Multi-Stop Route** mode from the top-right section next to the One-Stop Route mode. After activating the mode, set multiple spots on the map by clicking your required place. Define the number of trips and speed. Click **Start Moving** to initiate the process.

**Note:** Select the spots along a specific road to prevent the game developer from thinking you are cheating.

![activate multi stop simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Step 2View Multi-Stop Route Movement

As the simulation starts, click **Pause** at any instance where you want to stop the simulation. You can also **Clear** all settings if required.

![execute multi stop route simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

### Part 3: Use Joystick for More Flexible GPS Control (Joystick Movement)

Dr.Fone has integrated the joystick feature into the Virtual Location program to spare 90% of the labor for GPS control. You can always find the joystick on the lower left part in teleport mode. And you can also click the joystick button in the upper right (the 5th one) to use the joystick feature.

![try joystick movement for simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png)

The joystick, like one-stop route or multi-stop route modes, aims to facilitate GPS movement on the map. But what's better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.

- **Automatic GPS movement:** Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.
- **Manual GPS movement:** Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.

## Part I: Purpose of Mock Location Apps

The sole purpose of mock location apps or software is to help users spoof/ mock location to somewhere they are physically not. This may or may not be illegal/ immoral depending on how you use the apps, but who are we to judge! We are here to simply help you with the process.

- Prank your friends and family by showing your location in some other country and have some healthy laughs at their expense!
- Access geographically restricted content such as on streaming platforms. Mocking your location to somewhere where your favorite shows and movies are available helps you watch them from the comfort of your home, wherever in the world that may be!

## Part II: Is It Safe to Mock Location? Can It Be Detected?

One of the most frequent and completely understandable concern and question on people’s minds when they talk about location spoofing is whether is it safe to mock location whether it can be detected and what the consequences are.

Answer: Location spoofing is safe and will go undetected as long as it is done sensibly and with the right mock location app on your iPhone and Android. You have nothing to worry about as long as you do not be particularly obvious about location mocking. This means that you should take care not to be hopping like a bunny from here and there in minutes.

## Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone

There are fewer mock location apps on the Apple Store due to Apple's strict policies on user privacy and security. Apple prioritizes maintaining a secure and reliable user experience, which limits the availability of apps that could potentially misuse location data.

Probably one of the most known apps at one point in time, iSpoofer was great at spoofing location on iPhone until Niantic, the makers of Pokémon GO, detected the app, and banned it.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location can be used to effectively spoof GPS coordinates on Android devices as well.

That is not the case with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android) where a location once set remains set as long as you want it to, and will not jump.

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.
