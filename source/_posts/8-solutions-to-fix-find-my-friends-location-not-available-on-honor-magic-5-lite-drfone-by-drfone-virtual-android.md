![find my friends location not available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Honor Magic 5 Lite ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Honor Magic 5 Lite device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Honor Magic 5 Lite device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Honor Magic 5 Lite device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Honor Magic 5 Lite device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Honor Magic 5 Lite device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Honor Magic 5 Lite device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Honor Magic 5 Lite  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Honor Magic 5 Lite  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

### Tip 3: Adjust Honor Magic 5 Lite  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem.

Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection.

Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.
