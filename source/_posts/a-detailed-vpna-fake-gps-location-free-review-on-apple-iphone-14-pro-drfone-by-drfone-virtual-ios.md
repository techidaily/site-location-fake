There is no doubt that Find My Friends is an excellent application for location tracking. It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don't stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working.

![find my friends location not available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Apple iPhone 14 Pro ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Apple iPhone 14 Pro  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

![enable location services](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg)

### Tip 3: Adjust Apple iPhone 14 Pro  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

![check internet connection](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg)

### Tip 5: Enable Share My Location

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For Apple iPhone 14 Pro  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

![enable share my location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg)

Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.

For Android users, go to "Settings" > "Additional settings" > "Privacy" > "Location", and choose the location mode to enable it.

### Tip 6: Restart the Apple iPhone 14 Pro  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Apple iPhone 14 Pro  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Apple iPhone 14 Pro  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Apple iPhone 14 Pro  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

![restart Apple iPhone 14 Pro](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Apple iPhone 14 Pro .jpg)

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.

### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you've faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.

## How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location On Apple iPhone 14 Pro?

Life360, the app for family and friends, allows you to see where your loved ones are when you open the app. The app shows the current location of your contacts and will tell you the last time they were seen and if they are in an emergency.

However, there's a good chance that you've seen this message multiple times: "Your phone is missing from Life360. Please contact your cellular carrier and try again". This message indicates that your phone is not connected to the internet.

As a result, your contacts, photos, and messages are not showing. Life360 may be using cellular data instead of Wi-Fi, but it's not certain. To avoid this, let us read what we should know.

## Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?

### Interference From Nearby Devices/Networks

In some cases, Life360 may not be able to determine the location of your device because it is being interfered with by other nearby devices or networks. For example, if you have an iPhone or iPad, it may be using the same cell tower as your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

The Life360 app has to use the closest available cell tower to determine your location. So if another device uses the closest tower, Life360 will use that instead.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Poor Signal

A poor signal in a particular region, particularly if you're commuting, is the most common cause of Life360's incorrect location. When your phone is in a poor signal area, the app will use the internet instead of cellular data to determine the location of your contacts.

Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the network lines to determine whether or not this is indeed the source of the problem that prevents your Life360 from being found.

To get more information about how often does life360 update location, read about the Life360: Learn How Everything Works!

## Part 2: How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location Issue?

There are several ways to fix the Life360app problems that life360 not updating its location. Let's check them out one by one.

### Method 1: Review the Internet settings

The weak internet access contributes to the location display's unreliability in life 360. If you notice that life360 is displaying the wrong location, you should examine your Internet connection settings to prevent life360 from displaying an inaccurate location.

Switch off the option that saves power and then turn on the wireless Internet connection.

You may turn off your smartphone's power-saving mode by heading to the status bar and selecting the appropriate option.

![review the internet settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_1.jpg)

Please note that this is just for Android users. Also, do not forget to consider that your Android smartphone's settings may vary from those listed below.

The "switch off low power mode" option may be found in the "Settings"> "Battery" menu on an iOS device.

Android users should also follow this procedure if life360 displays an incorrect location. For battery conservation, numerous programs are disabled when the low power state is engaged.

### Method 2: Double-check Your Current Location in the Settings

If life360 shows the incorrect location, the smartphone's location services significantly come into play. The location settings must be activated to prevent the life360 location issue, and the current program must be updated accordingly.

Scrolling horizontally on the status bar on an Android device is all that is required for consumers to visit the website. Of course, you can also run the software in the background, which may be accomplished in a variety of straightforward but distinct ways based on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device's model.

![double-check your current location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_2.jpg)

You may access the Background App Refresh function by going to the settings menu on your iOS device and selecting "Settings," followed by "General," and then selecting "Background App Refresh." Next, launch the location services function by navigating to "Settings"> "Privacy"> "location services" and selecting "Location Services" from the drop-down menu.

After that, touch on the symbol that represents Life360, as shown below; this will take you to a screen where you may change "Allow Location Access" to "Always" and "Enable Precise Location."

### Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time

Only one device may be used to sign in to the Life 360 app at a time. To prevent the life360 false location problem, log out of all other devices and use just one. When many devices are logged into Life 360 simultaneously, the user's location might be incorrectly determined.

If you want reliable results, you must be logged in from the same device. If you use numerous devices simultaneously to log in to Life360, it will report incorrect location errors for each one. Therefore, it is possible to get inaccurate data. Use a single device to log into life360 to prevent the issue of a wrong location showing up.

## Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?

Two of the most important and easy ways to keep your location on life360 in one place are:

### 1\. Stopping both Wi-Fi and Cellular Data Transmissions

If you disconnect from the internet, Life360 will no longer work, and your last known position will be shown.

Because all other applications are disconnected, this solution has a significant drawback: it prevents alerts, instant messengers, and other applications from working properly. In addition to the fact that you're unable to use the internet, people in your circle will notice something wrong. In addition, it may not be adequate to fake your location.

![stopping both wi-fi and cellular data transmissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_3.jpg)

Those with an iPhone have the advantage of being able to disable the usage of cellular data directly inside the application's settings. However, those with an Android device will need to resort to other approaches.

iPhone users may access the Cellular setting by going to the Settings app and tapping on it. This will switch off the cellular data for the Life360 app. Turn off Life360 by swiping the switch to the off position mentioned above. Life360 will not be able to provide an accurate location report for you so long as there is no Wi-Fi access.

![stopping both wi-fi and cellular data transmissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_4.jpg)
