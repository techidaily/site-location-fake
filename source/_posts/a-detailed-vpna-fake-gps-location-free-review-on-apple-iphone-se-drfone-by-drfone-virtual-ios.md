## What are Location Permissions Life360 On Apple iPhone SE?

Sometimes you need to decide whether you can share certain personal information or data about yourself with others, which may involve location permissions.

Location permissions Life360 allows you to share the location of your device with other apps, even if those apps aren't in your app library. It's usually a good idea to use location permissions sparingly, but sometimes you'll need to use them.

Life360 uses location permissions for a few different reasons. For example, Life360 uses location permissions to show nearby friends when they check in to places so that you can see who is nearby and what they're up to.

## Part 1：What Does "Location Permissions Off" Mean on Life360?

There are two ways to prevent GPS tracking on the phone: switch off the phone's GPS or take off Life360 rights to track your whereabouts using GPS.

It's possible that Life360 won't work properly if you don't accept the permissions it requests during the installation process. When it comes to authorizing access to Life360, you have the following choices available to you:

If you choose the 'never option', the application will not be granted the required rights. As a result, the software may fail to perform as it is meant to. Whether you're unclear if you want to offer the program complete access or not, this is the ideal 'Ask any time' decision to bring.

Your location may be granted every time the app is used if you wish. 'While the App' setting permits accessibility to Location Services only when the app itself or one of its functionalities is currently displayed on the screen.

Your device's status bar may glow blue and display a message notifying you that an application is currently using your location data if the While Using the App setting is enabled for one of your apps.

"Always" grants the software all the permissions it needs. So, for example, allowing location permission will be done – every time the app launches. As a result, the software can track your location even if the application is closed.

## Part 2：Can My Apple iPhone SE Be Tracked If Location Services Are Off?

If you misplace your phone or want to run an application that requires to access your location, you may use the already developed location settings on your smartphone. Suppose, on the other hand; you don't want anybody to track your phone?

Is it possible to track a phone even if the location services are disabled? Mobile phones can be tracked even when location services are off, and the answer to that question is, "Yes."

Disabling your phone's location services might help you hide your current whereabouts. This is critical if you don't want others to be able to follow your movements or activities. However, other methods may still find a smartphone's overall geolocation using different ways.

### 1\. Cell-Site Simulators

A cell-site simulator is a device that can imitate a mobile phone tower and force a nearby mobile phone to connect to it. Cell site simulators can be purchased online or at a local electronics store. Law enforcement agencies use them to locate a phone without a warrant.

### 2\. Malware or Spyware

Malware and spyware can use various techniques to track your phone's location. For example, a malware program may be able to detect your location based on Your Apple iPhone SE's hardware.

Some mobile malware or spyware can detect and track your location without the need for the user's consent.

### 3\. Cell Towers

Cell towers can provide a rough estimate of a phone's location. A cell tower is a network access point that connects a mobile phone to the Internet. A smartphone's location can be found by triangulating the position of cell towers near your device. This method works best when the cell towers are close together.

### 4\. Wi-Fi Snooping

When a Wi-Fi hotspot is nearby, your phone can connect to it without needing to connect to a cell tower. Your phone can then transmit the signal back to the hotspot, which will record the Apple iPhone SE device's IP address.

## Part 3：How Do I Pause Life360 without My Parents Knowing?

There are many ways to ensure your parents do not know where you are and what you are doing. Some of these methods are:

### 1\. Switch to the Airplane Mode

Turning on Airplane Mode on your smartphone is another fast approach to preventing Life360 from broadcasting your whereabouts without your parents being aware. Unfortunately, you'll be unable to use your phone's internet connection after setting off Airplane Mode, so you'll lose your GPS position.

![switch to the airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/what-are-location-permissions-life360-1.jpg)

### 2\. Make Sure to Turn Off Circle's Location Sharing

It's your choice whether or not you want to share your location information with others in a particular circle or detach from a circle.

- When you're done monitoring your position, choose a circle on the UI to do so.

![turn off circle's location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/what-are-location-permissions-life360-2.jpg)

### 3\. Stop Using the GPS on Your Device

### 4\. Take use of a Burner Phone

Burner phones make it very easy to disable location tracking on Life360. In addition, disposing of a burner phone keeps your personal information private and secure.

- Install Life360 on the burner phone, and then login in using the same account you used on your primary device.
- Establish a connection between your phone and the free Wi-Fi that is accessible.

Using programs like Life360, parents can keep tabs on their children and teens. However, for some children and teenagers, Life360 disturbs their privacy, and they don't enjoy being tracked around the clock by the program.
