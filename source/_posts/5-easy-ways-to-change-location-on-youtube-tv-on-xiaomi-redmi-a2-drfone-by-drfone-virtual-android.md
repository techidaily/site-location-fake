Unfortunately, the app only runs when the location services on any device are turned on, and the user permits it to run in the background. It does not work when the Xiaomi Redmi A2 device is turned off, or its battery is dead.

The paid features of life360 notify circle members when you text while driving. Even if the user turns this feature off, it will still show that you are doing something on your phone while driving.

**6\. Battery level:** Life360 may have access to the battery level of the Xiaomi Redmi A2 devices connected to the app. This information can be used to provide alerts when a family member's device is low on battery.
