## 6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Nubia Z50 Ultra

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Spotify’s booming audio business is proof that people are in love with its services. If you want to listen to your favorite retro song, or you want to discover the latest hits, Spotify has everything. You can also listen to some really good podcasts and album hits. But what most of us don’t know is that your Spotify Location can determine what kind of content you might come across on the platform.

Your playlist suggestions depend on the country and region you are staying in. And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.

## **Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify**

Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.

**Region Specific Content**

![region specific spotify content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg)

The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.

**Geo-Based Suggestions**

![sopify playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg)

Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.

**But is Spotify available everywhere?**

How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.

The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.

## **Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone**

Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content. To make that possible, you can use some of the best online tools to fake spotify location whenever you want. Instead of going for the regular Spotify Update Location, you can use these third-party applications to change the location on your iPhone devices (will reflect in Spotify too).

The Wondershare’s Dr. Fone is a very good application that lets you change location Spotify with a few easy steps. It hardly takes a few minutes and this is how you go about it-

## Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Nubia Z50 Ultra?

Pokémon Go is the phenomenon that hit us in 2016 and made us obsessed with the AR game based on real-time location. If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.

Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of "catching them all."

'Spoofing' location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you're in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.

## **Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?**

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways. Thus, Niantic (PoGo's Dev) made some strict rules against exploiting their game, giving some players an unfair advantage over others.

So, ****is PGSharp legal?**** No, Spoofing location, in general, is illegal. Hence, any apps like PGSharp, or Fake GPS Go, used to disguise actual real-time location and fake it, will result in an account ban.

 According to Niantic's terms and conditions:

- "Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device's location (for example through GPS spoofing).
- And _"_Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software)."

 If Niantic detects usage of a fake location or GPS spoofing app while playing Pokémon Go, they will impose a strike on your account.

- The first strike would make rare Pokémon s not visible to you for seven days.
- The second strike would temporarily ban you from playing the game for 30 Days.
- The third strike will permanently ban your account.

 You can appeal these strikes to Niantic if you think you've been banned without violation of any terms.

## ****Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android****

1. **PGSharp :**

![pgsharp-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp-interface.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729642&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1">Advanced Find and Replace for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
PGSharp is one of the most reliable ways to spoof your location while playing Pokémon Go. Niantic does not easily recognize its simple map-like UI as a fake location app.

****Note:**** It is recommended not to use your main account while spoofing; rather, you should use your PTC (Pokémon Trainer Club) account.

- To spoof the location with PGSharp, go to Google's "Play store," search "PGSharp," and install it.
- After installation, there are two versions: Free and Paid. For trying the app with the free version, a beta key is not required anymore, while for the paid version, a key from the developer is required.
- For the paid key, visit PGSharp's official website and generate a license key.

You must note that it may take two or more tries to generate a working key, and often it may show an "out of stock." message.

- After opening the app and applying the key, you can spoof the location with ease.

****Note:**** You may need to allow "Mock location" from debugging options. For this, go to "Settings," then to "About Phone," then you need to tap on "Build number" seven times to enable developer's mode, and finally go to "Debugging" to allow "Mock location."

2. ****Fake GPS Go:****

![fake gps go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/fake-gps-go.jpg)

<a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Fake GPS Go is another location spoofer app for Android that is reliable and free. This app allows you to fake your real-time location and enables you to spoof it to any place in the world. This is one of the easiest solutions to playing Pokémon   Go while spoofing location without getting detected with its real-map-like UI. Moreover, this app does not even require root access.

- To install Fake GPS Go, go to Google's "Play store," search "Fake GPS Go," and install it.
- Then, go to your phone's "Settings" and then "System" followed by "About Phone," and tap on the "Build Number" 7 times to enable the Developer Options.
- Then you need to go to "Debugging" in "Developers Options" to allow "Mock location."
- And then, you can use this app to not only spoof your location but virtually walk around a route at a designated pace to make it look as real as possible for being undetected by developers like Niantic.

3. **VPN:**

![vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/vpn.jpg)

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) App is the safest option to spoof your location while playing PoGo, as it masks your IP address and uses a server in any other location.

Moreover, some VPNs would also encrypt your data, so it would not be easy for Game Devs to track it.

- To install a VPN, go to Google's "Play store," search the VPN of your choice and install it.
- Close the Pokémon Go app from running in the background to prevent detection of the VPN.
- Now, select a location server to any place before opening the PoGo app again.

****Note:**** Some Free VPNs only mask your IP address and do not spoof your location, nor do they encrypt your data. Hence, selecting a good VPN app is imperative, which will spoof GPS location and data encryption.

You can use both VPNs (which do not spoof GPS location themselves) and the Fake location app simultaneously for extra reliability.

## ****Part 3: Best way to spoof on iOS – dr.fone Virtual Location****

Spoofing the GPS location on iPhones is more difficult and much more complex than it is on Android. However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.

Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select "Virtual Location" given on the first page of the program.

****Pro-Tips:****

- Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.
- Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.
- Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)
- After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.
- Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.
- Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.

Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who's on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.
