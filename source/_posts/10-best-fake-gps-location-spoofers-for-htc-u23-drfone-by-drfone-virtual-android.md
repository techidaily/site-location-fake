## Will the iPogo Get You Banned and How to Solve It On HTC U23

There are chances of getting an iPogo ban, but they are relatively high depending on how you use the tool.

iPogo comes with tons of add-on features that can be used to boost your Pokémon collection 10 folds. But it does that by breaking many rules and regulations created by Niantic. Here are some features of iPogo for Pokemon Go that are not by the books:

These methods can include analyzing movement patterns, comparing location data with known landmarks, or detecting inconsistencies in player behavior.
