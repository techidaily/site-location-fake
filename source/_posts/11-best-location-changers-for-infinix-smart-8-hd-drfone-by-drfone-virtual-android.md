### 3\. Setting Wi-Fi and Data Services to "Off."

Another typical method kids use to prevent their parents from monitoring their position is to disable Life360's Wi-Fi and Data. It works like this. If you don't want applications updating in the background, enable power-saving mode.

Use a wired connection. Adolescents can turn off Wi-Fi and data when using the Life360 app on an iPhone. Go to Settings, look for Life360, and disable Cellular Data, Background Refresh, and Motion & Fitness. You'll be able to keep track of where you are on Life360.

All these methods can be used to Stop Life360 from Tracking You. However, the best all-in-one solution is a third-party application called Dr.Fone. This Virtual Location Software helps you keep your tracking off, but you can also fake your location very easily in minutes.

### Conclusion

Can you track a phone if the location is off? Life360 has become a standard feature of many smartphones. Parents often use it to monitor their children's location. The fact that Life360 can be used to track users is quite disturbing. The good news is that there are ways to stop Life360 from tracking you. The best and all-in-one solution is a third-party application called [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/drfone-toolkit.html).
