## How to Share Location in Messenger On Asus ROG Phone 7?

We usually host a gathering once in a while and invite our friends to come over. Most of us are already used to organizing such activities because we’ve been doing that for a long time now. However, we cannot deny that it’s much easier nowadays than years ago. Why so? Simply because the communication channels available today at our disposal are more digital and more capable. For instance, Facebook Messenger now allows users to share their whereabouts in a snap of a finger. Yes. That feature is called Live Location.

The Live Location feature on Messenger works beyond sending the address or coordinates of your exact location. It basically visualizes your whereabouts by means of an interactive map and updates the details from time to time. That means the receiver can view not only your position but also your movements. Is that helpful? Absolutely yes. It’s indeed a game-changer in today’s already convenient world. Is it highly recommended? With proper handling and adequate caution, Messenger’s Live Location can definitely do more good than harm to the users.

In this article, we will delve into the highlights and benefits of Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing features. We will also provide some tutorials on **how to share Live Location** on Messenger. Continue reading below to learn more.



## Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Messenger’s Live Location

Facebook is well aware that sharing location details is essential to its users. That’s why developers have come up with a brilliant idea and rolled out Live Location on Messenger. It basically works like other location-sharing features. However, Live Location provides more precise and thorough location information. It’s in map form, where you can view the exact location and track the movements of the sender. You’ll continue to see updates for as long as the sharing is not halted on the other end. To navigate it properly, try to read tutorials on how to share Live Location on Messenger.

## Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Asus ROG Phone 7

PPTP, which stands for Point to Point Tunneling Protocol is one of the oldest and most trusted ways of implementing a VPN. It was developed by Microsoft and uses a GRE tunnel with a TCP control channel to bypass various geo-based restrictions. Since free PPTP VPN has been around for years now and is pretty easy to setup, it is quite popular as well. Read on and learn the basics of PPTP VPN free with a free PPTP VPN list as well.

## Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?

The free VPN PPTP was earlier introduced by Windows, but was later adopted by all the other platforms like Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Even though the layer of encryption in free PPTP VPN is not as secure as other protocols, it makes it pretty fast. Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.
- Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.
- It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.
- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.
- The tunneling is of two types in PPTP – Voluntary and Compulsory. Voluntary tunneling is initiated from the client’s end while compulsory tunneling is initiated from the server’s end. Compulsory tunneling should be supported by the router.

4\. On the next window, you would be given an option to either dial directly or use a VPN. Click on the “Use my Internet Connection (VPN)” option to continue.

![Use my Internet Connection ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-4.png)

5\. Great! Now, you need to provide information related to the host and server. You can refer the free PPTP VPN list we have provided in the previous section and pick the server (and hostname) of your choice.

6\. As you would proceed to the next window, you need to provide the username and password of the PPTP VPN free you are using. The same can be obtained from our free PPTP VPN list.

7\. In the end, just click on the “Create” button to use your VPN. It will be listed under the available networks.

8\. Sometimes, we have to change Network Settings to make it work. To do this, just select the VPN you have created and visit its Properties.

![change nerwork settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-5.jpg)

9\. Go to the Security tab and make sure the type of VPN is listed as PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol). Also, the data encryption option should be “Optional Encryption (Connect even if no encryption)” and the option for “Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)” should be selected for “Allow these protocols”.

![pptp vpn properties](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-6.jpg)

10\. Furthermore, you can go to the General tab to make sure the server is specified correctly.

11\. Once it is done, you can save these changes and exit the interface. Now, go to the list of available networks and connect to the free PPTP VPN you have created.

![connect to free pptp vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-7.png)

That’s it! By following these steps, you would be able to create a free PPTP VPN Singapore, USA, UK, Canada, Germany, or any other location. Simply give this tutorial a try and pick the preferred option from our free PPTP VPN list. If you also have a suggestion for a free VPN PPTP that you want to add to your list, then let us know about it in the comments below.

## Part 4: An Easier Alternative to Setup VPN

You may find that there is a steep learning curve ahead to master PPTP VPN setup. In addition, the ways to set up PPTP VPN are quite different for various devices and PCs.

Is there an easier alternative to setup VPN?

Yes. There are quite a few easy-to-use VPN services available in the market, among which, [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/SH1EC) is one considered reliable by many users.

Some of its advantages are as follows:

- Supports VPN access on PCs and phones (even browser plugins available).
- Intuitive interface and easy operations.
- Offers 24/7 customer service.
- As low as about 3 USD per month.
