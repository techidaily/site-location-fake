### Part 3: Use Joystick for More Flexible GPS Control (Joystick Movement)

Dr.Fone has integrated the joystick feature into the Virtual Location program to spare 90% of the labor for GPS control. You can always find the joystick on the lower left part in teleport mode. And you can also click the joystick button in the upper right (the 5th one) to use the joystick feature.

The joystick, like one-stop route or multi-stop route modes, aims to facilitate GPS movement on the map. But what's better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.

- **Automatic GPS movement:** Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.
- **Manual GPS movement:** Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.
