## Part I: Why Do I Need To Change GPS Location On Nokia 105 Classic?

For an average user who uses an Nokia 105 Classic to make calls, watch videos, stay productive, and be on top of things, there is no need to change GPS location. However, there are reasons to get a location changer on Nokia 105 Classic in case you want to do any of the following:

- play location-aware games such as Pokémon GO
- go on dates outside geographical restrictions imposed by apps
- protect your privacy on websites and apps you visit and use
- access the geo-restricted content catalogs on streaming websites

## Part II: Can I Spoof My Location On Nokia 105 Classic iOS 16? Are There Any Risks?

The answer is YES, you can!

Using this GPS spoofer Nokia 105 Classic app on Nokia 105 Classic running iOS 16 is possible because this location spoofer Nokia 105 Classic app does not run on the Nokia 105 Classic at all! So thereby taking away the biggest pain point - you can use this location spoofer on Nokia 105 Classic no matter if you're using release version iOS or beta iOS!

About risks, there are zero risks to spoofing your location using a location spoofer Nokia 105 Classic app.

## Part III: How To Change GPS Location Without Jailbreak Using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location

The screen shows your real location – as per the actual GPS coordinates of your device.

![drfone virtual location interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

That's it! You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here's how:

**Teleporting To Another Location**

**Step 1:** Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode

**Step 2:** Start typing your destination location and click Go

![drfone virtual location teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3:** You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Nokia 105 Classic. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Nokia 105 Classic app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

**Step 1:** In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.

**Step 2:** Type your destination and click Go.

**Step 3:** A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 4:** Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.

**Step 5:** In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times. Click Match to start.

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can't deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

![drfone virtual location multi point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3:** Distance gets re-calculated after each selection. When you are satisfied with your route simulation, click Move Here.

![drfone virtual location multi point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

**Step 4:** Choose if you want to repeat this route and click Match to start the fun.
