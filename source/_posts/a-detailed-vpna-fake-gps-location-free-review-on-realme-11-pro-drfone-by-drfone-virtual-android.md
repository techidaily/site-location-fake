### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to. Find out how you can import and export GPX files with this location-changing application:

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.

![export location as a gpx file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png)

## How to Stop My Spouse from Spying on My Realme 11 Pro

_You may trust your spouse – but does your spouse trust you?_

If you suspect you have a spying husband or a spying wife, it’s very likely that they don’t. You may have something to hide or you may have nothing to hide, but either way, knowing that you’re being spied on feels like a terrible invasion of your privacy.

With GPS and advanced tracking tools, your whereabouts can be easily located all the time. With advanced technology and features, spying on your phone has become easier than ever before. So, if you are also doubting that your spouse is spying on your phone, you are reading on the right page.

In the following parts of this writeup, you can learn how to know if someone is spying on your cell phone, how to stop someone from mirroring your phone, and many other related concerns.

## Part 1: How can I tell if my husband or wife is spying on my Realme 11 Pro?

If you are suspecting that your phone is being hacked, several signs will indicate the same. So, if you too are looking for ways **how to know if someone is spying on cell phones, check the below-listed signs.**

### 1\. Your phone feels sluggish

If you feel that your phone is running slow than usual then it might be hacked as spyware tools that are downloaded are resource-draining and thus makes the Realme 11 Pro device sluggish.

### 2\. The battery is draining too fast

Though battery drain can alone not be a sign of the phone being hacked as with time the life of the battery starts decreasing. Still, it can be one of the signs as the hacking apps and tools are resource-draining which in turn decreases the battery life.

### 3\. High data usage

### Response 3: Seek a Divorce

Spying on your spouse is not only illegal but also unethical. So, if you feel that your trust has been shattered by your spouse by keeping an eye on your phone and your activities and staying with him/her does not seem to be possible, seek a divorce.
