## 6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Spotify’s booming audio business is proof that people are in love with its services. If you want to listen to your favorite retro song, or you want to discover the latest hits, Spotify has everything. You can also listen to some really good podcasts and album hits. But what most of us don’t know is that your Spotify Location can determine what kind of content you might come across on the platform.

Your playlist suggestions depend on the country and region you are staying in. And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.

## **Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify**

Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.

**Region Specific Content**

![region specific spotify content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg)

The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.

**Geo-Based Suggestions**

![sopify playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg)

Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.

**But is Spotify available everywhere?**

How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.

The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.

## **Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone**

Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content. To make that possible, you can use some of the best online tools to fake spotify location whenever you want. Instead of going for the regular Spotify Update Location, you can use these third-party applications to change the location on your iPhone devices (will reflect in Spotify too).

**Vikas Divyakirti on G2 Says:**

"Hola Fake GPS is a great service for anyone looking for a simple and location-changer application. The interface is really simple to use, and the time spent on the app is always a seamless experience. The security features offered are not that top-notch, but if you are looking for a free application just to change your location, then Hola Fake GPS is the way to go."

**Sheron on G2 Writes:**

"Hola Fake GPS has been a disappointing experience for me, and I'm pretty sure it will be for you. The attractive pricing and fast speed promise seem like it is the best location spoofer on the internet, but believe me, any other service on the internet is better than this. The company now constantly gets negative feedback from the giants like Google for its privacy violation. Overall, I would ask you not to download Hola Fake GPS app."

No. There is no grey area here. For years, the Hola Fake GPS Android app has been marked as one of the worst apps to change your location. It explicitly collects users' data, monitors users' activity, and sells them to third-party vendors that track you online.

Moreover, the accessible version of Hola Fake GPS isn't even encrypted, so there is always a chance of a man-in-the-middle attack, and so on.

## Bonus Tips: How to Use HolaVPN and a Location Spoofer to Fake GPS on Pokémon?

Pokémon Go is hugely popular, but some countries block players from accessing certain features or from downloading it at all. A free VPN service, HolaVPN, can be used to change your IP location to unblock Pokémon Go in these areas.

### 1\. What is HolaVPN?

HolaVPN is a VPN service that reroutes your internet traffic and hides your IP address. Unlike the Hola Fake GPS, the bandwidth and encryption levels allotted with the HolaVPN service are significant. Plus, it does not alter the location of a chosen application but all the applications on the internet. This means you can play Pokémon from any part of the world, access YouTube from another region, and so on.

### 2\. Why Use HolaVPN in Pokémon Go?

Various situations might prompt you to use HoleVPN in the Pokemon Go game. For example, some countries restrict players from downloading the Pokemon Go game or gaining full access to some in-game features. Also, some Schools and organizations' networks usually restrict players from playing the Pokemon Go game, so you need a VPN to be able to access the game.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. How to use a HolaVPN with Pokémon Go?

**Step 1.** Download the HolaVPN app on your device. Then, launch it and sign in to or create an account.

**Step 2.** Spoofing your GPS location on Android or iPhone requires a third-party app. Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is one of the best GPS spoofing apps.

**Step 3**: Locate the country you wish to change your location to and tap on it.

**Step 4:** Once you're connected to a particular country, your phone location will change instantly.

### In conclusion

Hola Fake GPS location is not the best application to change your GPS location. But if you are simply looking to access a restricted website because of IP location, HolaVPN can be helpful.

However, it is unsuitable for long-time use. For instance, Hola Fake GPS is known to monitor your online activity and collect information about you. So, it is best to use an advanced application like the Dr.Fone - Virtual Location as shown. As mentioned, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location uses the most advanced technology to spoof your GPS location, so apps like Pokémon Go can't find your actual GPS location.

Overall, if you are looking for the ultimate tool to spoof your GPS location, then [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is the best way to go.

## How to Share Location in Messenger On Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition?

We usually host a gathering once in a while and invite our friends to come over. Most of us are already used to organizing such activities because we’ve been doing that for a long time now. However, we cannot deny that it’s much easier nowadays than years ago. Why so? Simply because the communication channels available today at our disposal are more digital and more capable. For instance, Facebook Messenger now allows users to share their whereabouts in a snap of a finger. Yes. That feature is called Live Location.

The Live Location feature on Messenger works beyond sending the address or coordinates of your exact location. It basically visualizes your whereabouts by means of an interactive map and updates the details from time to time. That means the receiver can view not only your position but also your movements. Is that helpful? Absolutely yes. It’s indeed a game-changer in today’s already convenient world. Is it highly recommended? With proper handling and adequate caution, Messenger’s Live Location can definitely do more good than harm to the users.

In this article, we will delve into the highlights and benefits of Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing features. We will also provide some tutorials on **how to share Live Location** on Messenger. Continue reading below to learn more.



## Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Messenger’s Live Location

Facebook is well aware that sharing location details is essential to its users. That’s why developers have come up with a brilliant idea and rolled out Live Location on Messenger. It basically works like other location-sharing features. However, Live Location provides more precise and thorough location information. It’s in map form, where you can view the exact location and track the movements of the sender. You’ll continue to see updates for as long as the sharing is not halted on the other end. To navigate it properly, try to read tutorials on how to share Live Location on Messenger.

![facebook messenger live location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-1.jpg)

What if you wish to send a particular address from another location? There is no problem with that. Messenger allows users to search for a specific place, trace it on the map, and share the details. The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? It’s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.

Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information. Since the details are automatically generated through GPS, you can be sure that it is correct and definite. If you go out and track it down the neighborhood, you can certainly find the location in no time. Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while you’re out and keep yourself safe from any harm. Remember that safety remains a priority and comes above convenience.
