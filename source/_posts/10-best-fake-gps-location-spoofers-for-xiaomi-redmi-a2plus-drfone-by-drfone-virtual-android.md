### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to.

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.
