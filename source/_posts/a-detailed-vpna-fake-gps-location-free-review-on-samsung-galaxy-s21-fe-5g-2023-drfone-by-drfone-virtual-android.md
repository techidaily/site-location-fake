## How to Use Life360 on Windows PC For Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)?

Life360 is an online platform that utilizes geo-location services to help users share their real-time location with friends and family. The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.

As of now, you cannot run **_Life360 on computer_** as it is only available for Android and iOS. _Why?_ Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.

However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the **_Life360 app for Windows_**. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the **_Life360 app on Windows_**.

So, without wasting another second, let’s dive straight into the guide.

## Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?

First things first; why would anyone want to use a family locator app like Life360 on their PC? Well, the truth is everyone has their own reason to get **_Life360 for PC_**. For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.

In this situation, you can simply run the **_Life360 app on PC_**. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.

Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.

## Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?

Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.

The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.

However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and **_run the app on a Windows PC_**. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.

These methods include:

## Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator

The first and the most convenient way to run **_Life360 on computer_** is to use an Android Emulator. An emulator is basically a software that creates a virtual Android system on your computer. As a result, you’ll be able to run Android apps on your computer.

While there are dozens of Android emulators, Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and user-friendly option among all. Unlike other emulators, Bluestacks is easy to set up and use.

Here’s how you can run **_Life360 on a computer_** using Bluestacks Android emulator./

Step 1: Head over to Bluestacks official website and tap the download button.

Step 2: Open the installer and tap the “download” button. This will initiate the download process on your System.

Step 3: Once the installation process completes, Bluestacks will start to boot. Keep in mind that the first boot may take some time, depending on your system configurations.

## Part 4: Use Life360 by mirroring Android to Windows PC

While running an emulator is a great way to get **_Life360 on PC_,** it has its own set of challenges. For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.

In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run **_Life360 on PC_**. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.

Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.

Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.

Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.

Step 4: If you’re running Android Pie or above on your device, scroll down to open notification drawer and select “Smart View” (or “Cast” in some devices). You’ll see your PC listed here. Tap the button to start Android mirroring.

![mirroring android 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-3.jpg)

Step 5: It may take some while for the connection to establish. Once it does, you’ll be able to cast your device screen onto your computer and you’ll be able to run life360 on your system.

![mirroring android 4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-4.jpg)

## Part II: Is It Safe to Mock Location? Can It Be Detected?

One of the most frequent and completely understandable concern and question on people’s minds when they talk about location spoofing is whether is it safe to mock location whether it can be detected and what the consequences are.

Answer: Location spoofing is safe and will go undetected as long as it is done sensibly and with the right mock location app on your iPhone and Android. You have nothing to worry about as long as you do not be particularly obvious about location mocking. This means that you should take care not to be hopping like a bunny from here and there in minutes.

Apple prioritizes maintaining a secure and reliable user experience, which limits the availability of apps that could potentially misuse location data.

A quality product from Wootechy, iMoveGo is compatible with the latest iOS 17 and works well for what it does. It does not require jailbreak and comes with a trial version you can use to see what it does and if it fits your purpose.

#### 5\. iSpoofer

![ispoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-6.jpg)

Probably one of the most known apps at one point in time, iSpoofer was great at spoofing location on iPhone until Niantic, the makers of Pokémon GO, detected the app, and banned it. The app still works with some tricks up its sleeve, but we do not really recommend it, given that it was detected once and if you are detected using the app, you will be banned from the Poke-verse for good.

iToolab AnyGo for Android works in over 100 games and apps and can simulate movements between two points. The speed of movement can be customized and the app does not require you to root your Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023).

#### 4\. Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android)

![drfone virtual location android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-android.jpg)

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location can be used to effectively spoof GPS coordinates on Android devices as well. An issue that other spoofing apps present is that the location might jump between its true location and falsified location, which means that other apps might present a location spoofing solution that is not stable. That is not the case with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android) where a location once set remains set as long as you want it to, and will not jump.

Step 2: Connect your device and click Get Started button after accepting the disclaimer.

![drfone virtual location get started](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location opens. Click No Device at the top.

![drfone virtual location open](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01-1.png)

Step 3: You will now see a beautiful display showing your connected device. Click it and click Next.

![drfone virtual location device selection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

At this point, instructions change depending on the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device you connected. There are different instructions for iPhone and Android. Please visit [this](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/connect-android-ios-device-to-fake-location.html) link to connect your specific device.

Step 4: After you have connected your respective device, now comes the fun part – spoofing your location! If you want to simply prank your friends or use dating apps and other apps where you simply want a different location, you can use the Jump Teleport mode to simply change your location to anywhere in the world. However, in location-based games, you need to be seen walking or moving around in the environment. In that case, use the One-stop Route mode.

Here’s how to simulate movement using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to play location-based games.

Click the third option from the top right to enter One-stop Route mode. Enter a location to teleport to and click Move Here (1).

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.
