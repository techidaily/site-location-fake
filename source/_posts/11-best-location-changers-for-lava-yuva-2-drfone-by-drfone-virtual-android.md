## Part 3: User Reviews for Fake GPS Location Pro

Are you still confused about the performance of this location spoofer app? We have provided some user reviews below to help you out:

| Reviewer | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Bobby Nichols | "I was using a different app for quite some time. However, if My Lava Yuva 2 was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Lava Yuva 2 sit untouched for an hour..... YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!" |
| Brian Thompson. | "Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren't available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you'd charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user." |
| Gerald | "It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone? Also very sluggish." |

## Part 3: How to View GPX Files Offline on your PC?

As you can see, with the help of a GPX file generator, you can easily save your routes offline. Though, if you are looking for a Pokemon Map Generator app or a solution to view your GPX files on your PC, then try Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS). Developed by Wondershare, it can be used to view GPX files, spoof the location of your device, and even simulate its movement.

- You can create a route between multiple spots and export it as a GPX file from the application.
- There is an option to directly import GPX files on your computer and monitor the routes.
- You can simulate the movement of your device between multiple spots at a preferred speed.
- There is an inbuilt joystick that would let you move naturally on the map.
- No need to jailbreak your iPhone to spoof your location or simulate its movement.
