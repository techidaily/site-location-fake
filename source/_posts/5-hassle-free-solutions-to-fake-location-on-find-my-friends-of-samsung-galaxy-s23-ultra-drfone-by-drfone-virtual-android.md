## Part 3: User Reviews for Fake GPS Location Pro

Are you still confused about the performance of this location spoofer app? We have provided some user reviews below to help you out:

| Reviewer | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Bobby Nichols | "I was using a different app for quite some time. However, if My Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra sit untouched for an hour..... YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!" |
| Brian Thompson. | "Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren't available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you'd charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user." |
| Gerald | "It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone? Also very sluggish." |

What if you wish to send a particular address from another location? There is no problem with that. Messenger allows users to search for a specific place, trace it on the map, and share the details. The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? It’s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.

**NOTE:** Of course, you can only send pinned locations via Google Maps. The Facebook Messenger’s Live Location is available within the platform only.

## BONUS TIP: Protect Your Privacy With <u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>

There’s no denying that the location-sharing feature of Facebook Messenger is useful to many of us. It always comes in very handy whenever we need to meet people somewhere or invite them to our places. However, we should not become too complacent and let our guard down. Sharing sensitive information like whereabouts always comes with risk, regardless of the platform and the intention. Therefore, make it a habit to protect your privacy at all costs. In this regard, Wondershare Dr.Fone has something special to offer. Its Virtual Location feature, capable of modifying and simulating your location records, can be of great help for you. Don’t worry. It’s very easy to use. Here’s a short guide for you.



- **Step 1:** Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its [<u>official website.</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) Right after, install it on your computer.
- **Step 2:** Launch the newly installed software on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your smartphone using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions and perform the steps accordingly to ensure the connection between the two devices is stable enough to handle the succeeding operations.
- **Step 3:** Navigate to the left-side panel and then click **Toolbox.** On the main dashboard, click **Virtual Location.** Is it your first time using this feature? If so, allow Wondershare Dr.Fone to download additional resources. Don’t sweat it. It will only take a few minutes to complete.
- **Step 4:** Once the downloading process has concluded, Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location will automatically open on a separate window. From there, go to the top-right menu bar and then click **Teleport Mode.** It is the first icon that appears in the row.
