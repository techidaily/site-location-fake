![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 4: How to Fake Find My Friends location on Android

If you want to fake Find My Friends location on Android, you can easily configure Android devices to do it. For this, you can take help of an Android spoofer app. There are plenty of them available in Play Store. We will be using “Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer Free”. This is how to fake location on Find My Friends on Android.

**Step 1:** To use this, you don’t need to jailbreak or root your device until your Android is running on 6 and higher versions.

**Step 2:** Go to Play Store and search for the app. Install it after downloading.

When you install it rightly, this is how to do a little twisting to set it up with Find My Friends.

**Step 1:** To spoof people about the location, enable the developer settings in the first place. Simply head to “Settings” for this and go to “About Phone”.

**Step 2:** In the “Software Info”, you will see a build number. Tap on it nearly 6-7 times. The Developers options will be enabled now. This step is important because it will alter the security settings in your phone. As a result, tricking about the location will become easier.

**Step 3:** When developer options are enabled, launch the app. You will see an “ENABLE” option at the bottom. Tap on it to turn on mock locations feature.
