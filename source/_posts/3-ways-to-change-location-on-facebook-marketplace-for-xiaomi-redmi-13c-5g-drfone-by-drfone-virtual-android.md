You may find that there is a steep learning curve ahead to master PPTP VPN setup. In addition, the ways to set up PPTP VPN are quite different for various devices and PCs.

Is there an easier alternative to setup VPN?

Yes. There are quite a few easy-to-use VPN services available in the market, among which, [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/SH1EC) is one considered reliable by many users.

Some of its advantages are as follows:

- Supports VPN access on PCs and phones (even browser plugins available).
- Intuitive interface and easy operations.
- Offers 24/7 customer service.
- As low as about 3 USD per month.
