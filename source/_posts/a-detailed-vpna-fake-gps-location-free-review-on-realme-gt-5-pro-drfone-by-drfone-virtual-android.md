### FAQ 3: Can I jailbreak Realme GT 5 Pro to spoof location using Cydia?

The jailbreakers are only catching up to iOS 15 right now. It is being reported that they are close to jailbreaking iOS 15. As you are running iOS 16, you cannot jailbreak Realme GT 5 Pro to spoof location using Cydia. Furthermore, jailbreaking is not recommended in today's age given the security and privacy risks it poses.

### Conclusion

Location spoofer Realme GT 5 Pro apps are gaining prevalence today mostly among gamers who use these GPS spoofer Realme GT 5 Pro apps to catch more Pokémon. However, anyone can use a location changer on Realme GT 5 Pro for several other benefits such as breaking the geo-restrictions in dating apps and streaming websites to find dates outside your city limits for free and accessing a catalog of movies and TV shows that is not available in your region due to licensing or other considerations. There are several Realme GT 5 Pro location spoofer apps in the market, each extolling its virtues.

Not only can you use it on iOS 16 without problem as this app works from a computer, but you also do not have to think about security issues that jailbreaking a device brings because Dr.Fone Virtual Location changer on Realme GT 5 Pro works without jailbreaking the Realme GT 5 Pro.
