## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

![enable location services](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg)

### Tip 3: Adjust Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

![adjust date and time](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg)

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

![check internet connection](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg)

### Tip 5: Enable Share My Location

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

![enable share my location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg)

Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.

For Android users, go to "Settings" > "Additional settings" > "Privacy" > "Location", and choose the location mode to enable it.

### Tip 6: Restart the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

![restart Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G ](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G .jpg)

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.

### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you've faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.

## iSpoofer is not working On Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G? Fixed

Pokemon Go is one of the most appreciated games across the world. Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.

![Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg)

However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?

You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.

## **Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?**

If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.

![pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg)

Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.

One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.

![iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg)

iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.

So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.

![iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg)

There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.

## **Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?**

If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.

If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -

**VPNs** - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.

![VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg)

**Apps on App Store** - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.

![App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg)

If you are looking for a sure shot at changing your location without any hassle, then the best suggestion would be to use [Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) Changer. WIthin 3-4 steps you can easily change your location to anywhere in the world. This is how you do it -

## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try
