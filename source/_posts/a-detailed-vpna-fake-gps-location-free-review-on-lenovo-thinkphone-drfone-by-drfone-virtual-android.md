## Part 2: How to Change GPS in ML on iOS Devices

Wondershare Dr.Fone has always amazed us with its incredible tools and features, one of which is Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. Dr.Fone - Virtual Location comes in handy if you're playing Mobile League on an iOS device because it hides your current location. It will also allow you to change your location virtually, allowing you to be in any location without jailbreaking.

It is compatible with all the location-based apps and works seamlessly**,** so you don’t have to worry about the apps glitching. But if you are an Android user, then Dr.Fone doesn't enable fake location on Android games, but it lets you change the location of your Lenovo ThinkPhone. However, it fully supports all the games available such as **fake GPS Mobile Legends** on iOS devices.
