<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Step 2:** Launch Dr.Fone

![wondershare drfone software interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 3:** Choose Virtual Location and connect your phone.

![wondershare drfone virtual location module](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4:** Click Get Started. NEW Feature: Infinix Hot 40 Pro users are now able to go wireless after setting this up the first time!

The screen shows your real location – as per the actual GPS coordinates of your device.

![drfone virtual location interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

That's it! You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here's how:

**Teleporting To Another Location**

**Step 1:** Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode

**Step 2:** Start typing your destination location and click Go

![drfone virtual location teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3:** You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Infinix Hot 40 Pro. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Infinix Hot 40 Pro app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

**Step 1:** In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.

**Step 2:** Type your destination and click Go.

**Step 3:** A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4:** Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.

**Step 5:** In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times. Click Match to start.

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can't deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

![drfone virtual location multi point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3:** Distance gets re-calculated after each selection. When you are satisfied with your route simulation, click Move Here.

![drfone virtual location multi point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

**Step 4:** Choose if you want to repeat this route and click Match to start the fun.

## Part IV: FAQs

Here are some commonly asked questions to help you with location spoofer Infinix Hot 40 Pro apps.

### FAQ 1: Will a location spoofer Infinix Hot 40 Pro app damage my Infinix Hot 40 Pro or its GPS?

Not in the least. Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer on Infinix Hot 40 Pro works from the computer and does not affect either the Infinix Hot 40 Pro or the GPS chip inside the Infinix Hot 40 Pro.

### FAQ 2: Do I need to jailbreak to use a location spoofer Infinix Hot 40 Pro app?

### FAQ 3: Can I jailbreak Infinix Hot 40 Pro to spoof location using Cydia?

The jailbreakers are only catching up to iOS 15 right now. It is being reported that they are close to jailbreaking iOS 15.
