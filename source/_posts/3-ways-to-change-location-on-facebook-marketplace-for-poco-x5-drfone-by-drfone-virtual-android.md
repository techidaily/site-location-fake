## Will the iPogo Get You Banned and How to Solve It On Poco X5

Pokemon Go has graced one of the most popular mobile games right from the day it was launched. It requires players to move around one place to the other in reality to capture Pokémon.

It allows you to move from one place to another with just one-tap. As it is a cheat tool, you might want to know can iPogo get you banned? There are chances of getting an iPogo ban, but they are relatively high depending on how you use the tool.

iPogo comes with tons of add-on features that can be used to boost your Pokémon collection 10 folds. But it does that by breaking many rules and regulations created by Niantic. Here are some features of iPogo for Pokemon Go that are not by the books:

These methods can include analyzing movement patterns, comparing location data with known landmarks, or detecting inconsistencies in player behavior.

### Part 2: Movement Simulation Between two Places

Step 1: Launch the tool and look for the first icon at the upper right screen which is “one-stop route”. Choose the place you want to travel on the map. You will know the distance in the pop-up box.

Step 2: The slider located below the screen needs to be dragged to set the speed of travelling. You can choose cycling speed or the speed you want. Hit on “Move Here” afterwards.
