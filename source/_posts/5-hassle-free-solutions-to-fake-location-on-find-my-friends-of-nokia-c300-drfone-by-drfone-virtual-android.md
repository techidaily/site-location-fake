#### 5\. iSpoofer

![ispoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-6.jpg)

Probably one of the most known apps at one point in time, iSpoofer was great at spoofing location on iPhone until Niantic, the makers of Pokémon GO, detected the app, and banned it. The app still works with some tricks up its sleeve, but we do not really recommend it, given that it was detected once and if you are detected using the app, you will be banned from the Poke-verse for good.

#### 4\. Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android)

![drfone virtual location android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-android.jpg)

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location can be used to effectively spoof GPS coordinates on Android devices as well. An issue that other spoofing apps present is that the location might jump between its true location and falsified location, which means that other apps might present a location spoofing solution that is not stable. That is not the case with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android) where a location once set remains set as long as you want it to, and will not jump.

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.

## Closing Words

Using a mock location app can be fun. You can use it for recreational purposes such as pranking friends. You can use it for practical purposes such as saving money on dating apps by mocking location on Android and iPhones to anywhere around the world to meet new people. You can use it to simulate movement anywhere in the world in location-based games. You can also use mock location apps to effectively change your geographical location to watch content not available in your true geographical area. Whatever your reason may be, what you need is a reliable mock location app so that you can spoof your location undetected. Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is one such app you can trust with your eyes closed. It is the most comprehensive location spoofer for Android and iPhone for consumers. Download it today and enjoy newfound freedom!
