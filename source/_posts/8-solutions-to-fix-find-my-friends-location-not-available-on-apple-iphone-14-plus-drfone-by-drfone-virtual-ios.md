## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Apple iPhone 14 Plus ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Apple iPhone 14 Plus  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

### Tip 3: Adjust Apple iPhone 14 Plus  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

### Tip 5: Enable Share My Location

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For Apple iPhone 14 Plus  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

### Tip 6: Restart the Apple iPhone 14 Plus  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Apple iPhone 14 Plus  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Apple iPhone 14 Plus  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Apple iPhone 14 Plus  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

![restart Apple iPhone 14 Plus](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Apple iPhone 14 Plus .jpg)

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.

### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you've faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.

## How to Share Location in Messenger On Apple iPhone 14 Plus?

We usually host a gathering once in a while and invite our friends to come over. Most of us are already used to organizing such activities because weâ€™ve been doing that for a long time now. However, we cannot deny that itâ€™s much easier nowadays than years ago. Why so? Simply because the communication channels available today at our disposal are more digital and more capable. For instance, Facebook Messenger now allows users to share their whereabouts in a snap of a finger. Yes. That feature is called Live Location.

The Live Location feature on Messenger works beyond sending the address or coordinates of your exact location. It basically visualizes your whereabouts by means of an interactive map and updates the details from time to time. That means the receiver can view not only your position but also your movements. Is that helpful? Absolutely yes. Itâ€™s indeed a game-changer in todayâ€™s already convenient world. Is it highly recommended? With proper handling and adequate caution, Messengerâ€™s Live Location can definitely do more good than harm to the users.

In this article, we will delve into the highlights and benefits of Facebook Messengerâ€™s location-sharing features. We will also provide some tutorials on **how to share Live Location** on Messenger. Continue reading below to learn more.



## Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Messengerâ€™s Live Location

Facebook is well aware that sharing location details is essential to its users. Thatâ€™s why developers have come up with a brilliant idea and rolled out Live Location on Messenger. It basically works like other location-sharing features. However, Live Location provides more precise and thorough location information. Itâ€™s in map form, where you can view the exact location and track the movements of the sender. Youâ€™ll continue to see updates for as long as the sharing is not halted on the other end. To navigate it properly, try to read tutorials on how to share Live Location on Messenger.

![facebook messenger live location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-1.jpg)

What if you wish to send a particular address from another location? There is no problem with that. Messenger allows users to search for a specific place, trace it on the map, and share the details. The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? Itâ€™s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.

Convenience is just one thing. Messengerâ€™s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information. Since the details are automatically generated through GPS, you can be sure that it is correct and definite. If you go out and track it down the neighborhood, you can certainly find the location in no time. Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while youâ€™re out and keep yourself safe from any harm. Remember that safety remains a priority and comes above convenience.

### How to Grant Facebook Messenger the Permission to Access Your Location?

Facebook Messengerâ€™s location-sharing feature will not work without the necessary access. Thatâ€™s why you should first configure the permission settings on your mobile device to avoid unwanted disruptions. Donâ€™t worry. Itâ€™s indeed a piece of cake. Check out the tutorial provided below.
