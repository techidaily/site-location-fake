**Step 3: Modify the location address**

Tap ‘Get Started’ option then add a new address in the ‘Teleport’ mode. To choose ‘Teleport’ mode, you have to select the first icon at the top-right screen. Next, enter the address at the top left side of the window. You can enter any address around the globe to fake GPS joystick location.

**Step 4: Changed Location in the app**

Now the Dr.Fone app displays your desired address as your current location. You can verify it by spotting the location on the map view.

**Step 5: Location on iPhone**

Next, you must check your default current location in map view on iPhone, and you will witness the modified location in pace with your desired address.

**Step 6: Play Pokemon Go without moving**

Now use the “one-stop route” or “multi-stop route” to simulate the real-world movement without moving. Just play Pokemon go to explore new Pokemons on different locations and gain more points through an effective fake GPS joystick location app Dr.Fone.
