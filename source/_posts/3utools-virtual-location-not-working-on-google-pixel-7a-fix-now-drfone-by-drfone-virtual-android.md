## Part 2: Fix 3utools Virtual Location Not Working Issue \[8 ways\]

### 1\. Solving the internet issues

Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.

If this is the cause of your **3uTools virtual location not working**, there isn't much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to "Mapbox" to see if it addresses the problem.

### 2\. Restarting and Closing the Software

When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.

![restart the software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg)

### 3\. 3uTools reinstallation

The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.

![reinstall 3utools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg)

### 4\. Restarting Your Computer

Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.

![restart computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg)

### 5\. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked

When you encounter a 'not working' problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.

![verify the netwrok connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg)

### 6\. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded

Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.

### 7\. Changing the Source Map

Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt "Load embedded maps" to solve this issue.

![load embedded maps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-6.jpg)

Alternatively, change the source map between Google Maps and Open Street Maps.

### 8\. Uninstalling iTunes and rebooting your system

Many customers have reported encountering the "3uTools virtual location developer image load failed" problem, with the majority of them appearing to be iOS 17 users. 3uTools either does not load the location images or the screen becomes frozen.

Remove iTunes from your computer. Then, try restarting it. Install iTunes from the App Store once more. Restart your computer. After that, connect your iPhone to a PC and confirm that it is unlocked.

## How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location On Google Pixel 7a?

Life360, the app for family and friends, allows you to see where your loved ones are when you open the app. The app shows the current location of your contacts and will tell you the last time they were seen and if they are in an emergency.

However, there's a good chance that you've seen this message multiple times: "Your phone is missing from Life360. Please contact your cellular carrier and try again". This message indicates that your phone is not connected to the internet.

As a result, your contacts, photos, and messages are not showing. Life360 may be using cellular data instead of Wi-Fi, but it's not certain. To avoid this, let us read what we should know.

## Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?

### Interference From Nearby Devices/Networks

In some cases, Life360 may not be able to determine the location of your device because it is being interfered with by other nearby devices or networks. For example, if you have an iPhone or iPad, it may be using the same cell tower as your Google Pixel 7a.

The Life360 app has to use the closest available cell tower to determine your location. So if another device uses the closest tower, Life360 will use that instead.

### Poor Signal

A poor signal in a particular region, particularly if you're commuting, is the most common cause of Life360's incorrect location. When your phone is in a poor signal area, the app will use the internet instead of cellular data to determine the location of your contacts.

Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the network lines to determine whether or not this is indeed the source of the problem that prevents your Life360 from being found.

To get more information about how often does life360 update location, read about the Life360: Learn How Everything Works!

## Part 2: How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location Issue?

There are several ways to fix the Life360app problems that life360 not updating its location. Let's check them out one by one.

### Method 1: Review the Internet settings

The weak internet access contributes to the location display's unreliability in life 360. If you notice that life360 is displaying the wrong location, you should examine your Internet connection settings to prevent life360 from displaying an inaccurate location.

Switch off the option that saves power and then turn on the wireless Internet connection.

You may turn off your smartphone's power-saving mode by heading to the status bar and selecting the appropriate option.

![review the internet settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_1.jpg)

Please note that this is just for Android users. Also, do not forget to consider that your Android smartphone's settings may vary from those listed below.

The "switch off low power mode" option may be found in the "Settings"> "Battery" menu on an iOS device.

Android users should also follow this procedure if life360 displays an incorrect location. For battery conservation, numerous programs are disabled when the low power state is engaged.

### Method 2: Double-check Your Current Location in the Settings

If life360 shows the incorrect location, the smartphone's location services significantly come into play. The location settings must be activated to prevent the life360 location issue, and the current program must be updated accordingly.

Scrolling horizontally on the status bar on an Android device is all that is required for consumers to visit the website. Of course, you can also run the software in the background, which may be accomplished in a variety of straightforward but distinct ways based on the Google Pixel 7a device's model.

![double-check your current location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_2.jpg)

You may access the Background App Refresh function by going to the settings menu on your iOS device and selecting "Settings," followed by "General," and then selecting "Background App Refresh." Next, launch the location services function by navigating to "Settings"> "Privacy"> "location services" and selecting "Location Services" from the drop-down menu.

After that, touch on the symbol that represents Life360, as shown below; this will take you to a screen where you may change "Allow Location Access" to "Always" and "Enable Precise Location."

### Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time

Only one device may be used to sign in to the Life 360 app at a time. To prevent the life360 false location problem, log out of all other devices and use just one. When many devices are logged into Life 360 simultaneously, the user's location might be incorrectly determined.

If you want reliable results, you must be logged in from the same device. If you use numerous devices simultaneously to log in to Life360, it will report incorrect location errors for each one. Therefore, it is possible to get inaccurate data. Use a single device to log into life360 to prevent the issue of a wrong location showing up.

## Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?

Two of the most important and easy ways to keep your location on life360 in one place are:

### 1\. Stopping both Wi-Fi and Cellular Data Transmissions

If you disconnect from the internet, Life360 will no longer work, and your last known position will be shown.

Because all other applications are disconnected, this solution has a significant drawback: it prevents alerts, instant messengers, and other applications from working properly. In addition to the fact that you're unable to use the internet, people in your circle will notice something wrong. In addition, it may not be adequate to fake your location.

![stopping both wi-fi and cellular data transmissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_3.jpg)

Those with an iPhone have the advantage of being able to disable the usage of cellular data directly inside the application's settings. However, those with an Android device will need to resort to other approaches.

iPhone users may access the Cellular setting by going to the Settings app and tapping on it. This will switch off the cellular data for the Life360 app. Turn off Life360 by swiping the switch to the off position mentioned above. Life360 will not be able to provide an accurate location report for you so long as there is no Wi-Fi access.

![stopping both wi-fi and cellular data transmissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_4.jpg)

- No need to manually switch between apps.
- You can easily manage all your data.

**Disadvantages:**

- You cannot use other devices at the same time.
- If you lose the connection, you need to reconnect.

### 2\. Faking Your Location

It seems like everyone has their own way to try and fiddle with their location in real life. Some may use satellite images or even old maps and coordinates, while others will buy old phones and ship them to a random location. Whatever your method is, it's probably not the best one out there.

## Life360: Learn How Everything Works On Google Pixel 7a

Nothing is more important than your mobile device when it comes to your security, privacy, and family. Thanks to its easy-to-use features and excellent app, with Life360, your life will be as secure and private as possible.

Whether you're looking to sync photos, videos, contacts, messages, and locations with your mobile devices and computers or simply set up your home cameras to automatically send you alerts, Life360 is designed to be the most powerful mobile phone service provider you've ever seen.

It's the most secure and easiest-to-use service, but it's not the cheapest. So, let's know what Life360 is and how Life360 work.

## Part 1: What Is Life360?

A smartphone software called Life360 tracking system enables families to communicate, track their whereabouts, and get alerts about their loved one's safety and well-being.

When Life360 is installed on the phone, the administrator may create geo-fences specifying certain locations. For example, geo-fences might be employed to monitor family members' arrival and departure times. In addition to that, the program provides driving analysis by means of the Life360 Driver Protect module.

Additionally, BMW has incorporated Life360 into its onboard location tracking. Accident identification and rescue operations are provided through an app that tracks authorized drivers and offers monitoring and analysis.

Both parties need to have the app installed for one to be able to monitor the activities of the other. Using the app, you can see where your phone is at any given moment. A member of your family might know exactly where you are at any given time if they have the app on their phone.

Whether you are currently using the app or not, the Life360 app tracker will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of your mobile device. In addition, you may obtain real-time location information on each other, view it on a hidden map, and even choose to get automatic notifications anytime someone enters or departs a spot, according to the Life 360 website.

Every time a family member departs or comes someplace, an alert is sent to the rest of the family. You can share your location with an adult, and they can see how fast you were driving, how long it took you to come home, and who was home or at school while you were gone.

In addition, adults and children may obtain real-time instructions from a particular family member. For example, you may touch an icon of a family member to receive instructions to that user's location on the Life360 website.

## Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?

Previously, Life360 was criticized for being inaccurate, especially when locating people. However, the company has recently updated its system to ensure that the data it collects is accurate.

The Life360 app uses GPS technology to track your location. When you first install the app, you will be prompted to set up your location. This is done by entering your zip code, city, and state.

You will also be asked to select a default location. This will be used to determine your home address. Once you enter your zip code, city, and state, you will be able to view your location on a map.

Also, Life360 works best in urban areas. If you live in an area with many tall buildings, Life360 may not work as well.

## Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?

Life360 is a relatively new app, but it has been getting attention lately. People are wondering whether it is safe for them to use and whether or not it is worth it.

According to the Life360 website, the app is safe because it is encrypted. The encryption ensures that no one can intercept your communications.

If you are worried about privacy, you can disable the app's location tracking feature. You can also disable the feature if you want to be notified whenever someone enters or leaves a particular area.

You can also use the app without giving anyone else access to your location. You can create a guest profile.

There are no ads or in-app purchases. You do not have to give any information to Life360. You can use the app without giving any information.

Life360 is also very easy to use. You do not need to have any special training to use the app. You simply need to sign up and download the app.

Life360 is available for free on Google Play and Apple App Store.

## Part 5: Can a Location be faked on Life360?

What if You do not want your location to be tracked by someone else? One of the main reasons why people use Life360 is that it allows you to share your location with friends, family, and even strangers. However, if you do not want to be tracked by others, you need to know how to fake your location.

Unfortunately, you cannot spoof your location through Life360, so it is evident that you have to use another way to ensure that no one will know where you are. The easiest solution is an application called [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) which can help you change your location in real-time.

## Part 6: FAQs

### 1\. What are Life360 events?

Although Life360 events are a great way to keep your loved ones informed about your whereabouts, they also provide information about your location, like the weather, time, and date. You can even set an alert when you arrive at a specific location.

For example, if you want to see who is at your house, you can set an event to notify you when someone enters or leaves your home.

### 2\. What does protecting a drive on Life360 do?

Improve your family's driving habits by getting a weekly picture of everyone's driving habits. Gain a comprehensive understanding of the driving patterns of every member of the Circle.

Find out about things like your highest speed and whether or not you text while driving, among other things. Then, take a look at individual drives to find out details such as the exact route taken, the number of kilometers recorded, the peak speed, driving style, and the locations of any driving incidents.

When Circle members are on the road, whether driving, using public transportation, or traveling with companions, keep an eye on their peak speed.

### 3\. Why does life360 show walking instead of driving?

In brief, it is because walking is less likely to be used for commuting than driving. For example, if you live in a rural area, you may not have access to public transportation, and therefore, you would have to walk to work.

### 4\. What does it mean when life360 doesn't update?

It means that the Google Pixel 7a device you're using is not connected to the internet. In this case, you should check if your internet connection is working properly. If you're sure your internet connection is working fine, try restarting your device.

### 5\. Does Life360 work when your phone is off?

In the event that you switch off your phone, the GPS feature will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your phone is turned off.

However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data uploaded to your account. So, a life360 login online is necessary.

## Conclusion

Life360 is a useful application that helps you keep tabs on your loved ones. You can track location, receive notifications, and get alerts. But if you want to fake your location, [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is the most recommended product because of its unique features and easy-to-use interface.
