![find my friends location not available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Infinix Note 30 Pro ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Infinix Note 30 Pro device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Infinix Note 30 Pro device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Infinix Note 30 Pro device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Infinix Note 30 Pro device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Infinix Note 30 Pro device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Infinix Note 30 Pro device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Infinix Note 30 Pro  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Infinix Note 30 Pro  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 3: Adjust Infinix Note 30 Pro  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

![adjust date and time](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg)

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Infinix Note 30 Pro  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For Infinix Note 30 Pro  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

![enable share my location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg)

Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.

For Android users, go to "Settings" > "Additional settings" > "Privacy" > "Location", and choose the location mode to enable it.

### Tip 6: Restart the Infinix Note 30 Pro  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Infinix Note 30 Pro  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Infinix Note 30 Pro  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Infinix Note 30 Pro  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Infinix Note 30 Pro device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Infinix Note 30 Pro device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

### See What Fake GPS location - Hola's Users Have to Say

Hola Fake GPS location has mixed reviews from users. Here's what users have to say about the Hola Fake GPS application:

**Vikas Divyakirti on G2 Says:**

"Hola Fake GPS is a great service for anyone looking for a simple and location-changer application. The interface is really simple to use, and the time spent on the app is always a seamless experience. The security features offered are not that top-notch, but if you are looking for a free application just to change your location, then Hola Fake GPS is the way to go."

**Sheron on G2 Writes:**

"Hola Fake GPS has been a disappointing experience for me, and I'm pretty sure it will be for you. The attractive pricing and fast speed promise seem like it is the best location spoofer on the internet, but believe me, any other service on the internet is better than this. The company now constantly gets negative feedback from the giants like Google for its privacy violation. Overall, I would ask you not to download Hola Fake GPS app."

## Part 4. Is Fake GPS location - Hola Safe?

No. There is no grey area here. For years, the Hola Fake GPS Android app has been marked as one of the worst apps to change your location. It explicitly collects users' data, monitors users' activity, and sells them to third-party vendors that track you online.

Moreover, the accessible version of Hola Fake GPS isn't even encrypted, so there is always a chance of a man-in-the-middle attack, and so on.

Not to forget, Hola Fake GPS and its parent app, the HolaVPN, have also been removed from the Chrome Web Store numerous times. Additionally, it has a long history of controversies. So, it is only better to look for alternatives to Hola Fake GPS.
