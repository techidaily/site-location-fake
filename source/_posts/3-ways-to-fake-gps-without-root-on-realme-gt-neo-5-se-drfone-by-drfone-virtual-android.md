## Part 1: How Does Chrome Know Your Location?

Before discussing Google **Chrome's fake location**, it is important to know how Chrome detects your physical location. Google Chrome uses many ways to pinpoint your exact location, like your IP address, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Cell Tower data. Every internet connection has an IP address bound to a location that enables Chrome to identify your location.

Similarly, GPS location can easily be tracked if your phone device has it enabled. All the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections around you also have location information embedded in them. They can help Chrome track you as long as your device can detect them. If you use cell data, Google Chrome can also track you through cell towers.

## Part 2: How to Hide Location Services in Chrome?

If you are worried about Google Chrome detecting your physical location and sharing it with websites and apps, you can hide it easily. The process of hiding your location on Google Chrome is simple, even if you are using multiple devices. Below is the step-by-step process of hiding location services in Google Chrome on computer, Android, and iOS devices.

### Method 1: For Laptop and Desktop PCs

## Conclusion

Life360 is a handy app, but it can be frustrating when a child or teen doesn't want to use it. It's easy to fool the app and trick it into thinking that you're at home or school, but you're not. Hence, [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS/Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an excellent app for faking your location and keeping your personal information safe.
