## Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox

Before starting with **Firefox location spoof**, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.

### 1\. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API

Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user's location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can't use this API for location determination.

### 2\. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?

HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn't have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Vivo Y27 5G device's location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.

## Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers

Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.

### Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location

Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That's why it is better to **spoof the location on Firefox** rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:

**Step 1:** Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type "about:config" and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the "Accept the Risk and Continue" button to proceed further.

**Step 2:** First search for "Geo.enabled," and when it appears, toggle its value from "True" to "False" to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for "geo.provider.network.url" and press the "Pen" icon to edit it.

### Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension

Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the "[Location Guard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/)" add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add "Location Guard" and use it to alter your location are following:

**Step 1:** Click on the "Three Vertical Bars" icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select "Add-ons and themes." Tap "Extensions" from the left sidebar and search for "Location Guard" in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click "Add to Firefox" to add it to your browser.

![add the extension to firefox](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can choose between two options to protect your location's privacy. Using the "Privacy Levels" option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.

## Part 4: Use Life360 by mirroring Android to Windows PC

While running an emulator is a great way to get **_Life360 on PC_,** it has its own set of challenges. For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.

In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run **_Life360 on PC_**. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.

Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.

Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.

Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.

![mirroring android 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-1.jpg)

Step 3: Choose the “Projecting to this PC” option in the left menu-bar and make sure that “Available Everywhere” is selected.

![mirroring android 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-2.jpg)

Step 4: If you’re running Android Pie or above on your device, scroll down to open notification drawer and select “Smart View” (or “Cast” in some devices). You’ll see your PC listed here. Tap the button to start Android mirroring.

Therefore, we will share with you in this article some tips that you can use to fix some issues that you will encounter and what alternatives you can use in case you cannot fix the issue in Foneazy MockGo.

## Part 1: What is Foneazy MockGo?

Foneazy MockGo is a popular location spoofer tool that is used by users to use in their location-based AR games, or for some, using it with applications that require your location, such as Tinder. So that way, you are able to check what other locations in the world have in their area than being limited to the area that you are in.

Aside from giving you a temporary location, it also stimulates real-time movement, which is very important for players who use it for their games. Within just a few clicks, you can teleport yourself to any place in the world without having to need to book a flight. Aside from that, you can ensure the safety of your real location if you use this software.

May that be cycling, driving, or walking, you can choose the speed you want to simulate a real-life journey without having to do any steps yourself. They also have a beginner user-friendly interface that will not confuse first-time users

On another note, we will share with you the limitation of the Foneazy MockGo software. Currently, this application is only available for iOS phone users, and Android users. Therefore, you are not able to use this software. Another limitation is that it does not support macOS versions that are older than 10.10. Reaching out to their customer support can also take a long time as they take time to respond to you. Lastly, the software will stop updating, and you will need to check yourself if the software needs to be updated.

## Part 2: How to Fix Foneazy MockGo Not Working Issue

Being able to share a spoof location or use it in games is fun and a great way to fool any of your friends. However, while using the Foneazy MockGo software, you will encounter instances where it is not working properly.

**_Option #1:_** Check if the software is updated to the latest software. You can check if you need an update by going to the menu for the “check for upgrade” button. Once it says that an update is available, do update the software as the update could contain some fixes for some issues in the software from its previous versions.

**_Option #2:_** Make sure your iOS phone is also updated to the latest version. Double-check if your phone needs updating in the phone settings and update it as needed. If the phone is not updated, it can also hinder some features of the software.

**_Option #3:_** Ensure that your location sharing is enabled on your phone. Despite sharing a spoof location, you will still need to enable your location sharing so the software can track wherever you currently are. You can do this by going to your phone's setting and going to “location” to enable sharing.

**_Option #4:_** Restart your phone or computer. If you have exhausted all the tips we shared, you can try this basic troubleshooting to fix this issue. Usually, just a quick restart on your phone or computer can help to make your Foneazy MockGo work again.
