## Part 3: The Most Effective Way to Fake Location on iOS and Android

We have mentioned methods to change Play Store country manually and through VPN, but they still have a few limitations. Once you change the country's location on Google Play manually, the Play Store requires 48 hours to accept this modification. Moreover, you can only change the country's server location once a year. With VPN, many country servers are unreachable, and some servers can be reached only through a paid version. This makes the process expensive and time taking.

To avoid these hurdles and chaos, we recommend you to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to fake your location on both Android and iOS devices. This tool works in every situation and allows users to travel the globe through their phones free of cost. You can also travel with an exact GPS location just with a single click. Hence, this tool will work amazingly in faking your location without requiring you to change Google Play country's location.

Step 6: You are good to go now. The location will be changed as desired. You will see the chosen location fixed whenever you click the "Center On" icon. Also, the same location will be shown in the location-based apps.

### Mode 2: Simulate Movement Between two Places

Step 1: You can choose the “One-stop route” i.e. the third icon in the upper right after launching the program.

Step 2: Please opt for the place where you wish to move and you will get aware of that place’s distance.

Step 3: Now, you need to set the speed for how fast you wish to travel. You can choose walk, cycling speed or car speed by sliding the slider given at the bottom. Once done, hit on “Move Here” from the pop-up.

![choose walk, cycling speed or car speed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Step 4: In the next pop-up, you are supposed to enter the number defining the number of times you wish to move between the two places. Once this gets done, click “March”.

![move between the two places](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

Step 1: In this case, select the fourth icon at the upper right side. This icon denotes the “Multi-stop route”. Subsequently, select the locations one by one from where you want to travel.

Step 2: Note the pop-up box that now comes. It will make you know how far you are going to travel. Choose the moving speed.

![select the locations one by one](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Step 3: The next pop-up will ask you to enter the number for how many times you wish to show back and forth movements. Click “Start Moving” once done.

![enter the number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)
