## Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro using External Device

You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone 15 Pro location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone 15 Pro's geographic location.

The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone 15 Pro is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -

**Step 1**: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro's port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.

![double location dongle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg)
