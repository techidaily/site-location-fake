In this time of modern technology, it is hard to be away from your phone or even leave it at home. When any task that we plan to do, usually already have an application released for the sole purpose of doing that task and needing to do it on your phone. When we message our friends, have a video call with our family, or just simply order food to eat at home, you can do all of them on the Infinix Note 30 Pro device in your palm.

Another advantage of having our phones with us all the time is that you can also see the current location of either your friend or family. For Apple phone users, they have an app that is called "Find My Friends" that will show you the locations of the people that you are tracking. But what if you cannot find the location of the friend? We will find out the causes as to why no location can be found and how you can fix this in just a few simple steps.

## Part 1: Why does an Infinix Note 30 Pro say "no location found"?

When you are searching for your friend's current location and it shows that "no location found", there could be numerous reasons as to why that is happening. We have listed down the possible reasons why there is no location found.

![no location found](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/find-my-friends-no-location-found-1.jpg)

**_Option #1:_** Your friend has not signed in to the "Find My Friends" application. Make sure that they are registered in the application before tracking their location.

_**Option #2:**_ The other person's mobile is not connected to the internet or their phone is off. This could also be another common reason why you cannot see their location.

_**Option #3:**_ Make sure that their "Location Services" is turned on. Some users would turn this feature off which hinders the application from checking their current location.

_**Option #4:**_ The other user must have set up the wrong date and time. If the date and time do not correspond to the global time, then it will cause problems and difficulty with tracking that user.

**_Option #5:_** The application might not have been enabled under "Location Services". Make sure that the application has the permission to track your current location and you can do this by following the steps below.

![no location found](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/find-my-friends-no-location-found-2.jpg)

- _**Step 1:**_ Go to "Settings" and then "Privacy".
- _**Step 2:**_ You can then go to "Location Services" and make sure that the application "Find My Friends" is enabled to track your location.

## Part 2: Tips To Fix "No Location Found" Available

If you encounter an issue that says "No Location Found", there are numerous ways you can fix the "No Location Found" message on "Find My Friends" and we will share them with you.

_**Option #1:**_ Adjust your phone's date and time. You can reset your time by following the steps.
