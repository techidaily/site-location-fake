## 4 Methods to Turn off Life 360 On Vivo Y100A without Anyone Knowing

Life 360 has made tracking our friends and loved ones so easy. It is an excellent choice for staying updated about family when you have security concerns. Despite this, it can be intrusive when you need your privacy. If you’re a group member and wonder how to turn off Life360 without parents knowing on iPhone and Android devices, you’re in luck. This article will provide you with a complete guide on how to turn off Life 360 without anyone knowing.

## Part 1: What is Life 360?

Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch. This tracking app makes it easy to trace the location of your loved ones or anyone you want to track. But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.

![life360 for location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png)

Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.

![life360 map showing circles](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png)

Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency. In addition, the app automatically contacts the emergency contacts you added when you do this. However, this doesn’t change that it can get intrusive when you need some privacy. That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.

![sending help alert on life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.png)

## Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing

There are times when you want to turn Life360 off without it showing so that people don’t know your present location. But, if you have no idea how to go about it, you’re in luck. This section covers the best methods to stop sharing your location with friends and family on Life360.

### 1\. **Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360**

There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.

- First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.
- Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.

![locate the circle on life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png)

- Tap on ‘location sharing’ and click on the slider next to it to disable location sharing.

![click on location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.jpg)

- Now you can recheck the map, and it will show ‘location sharing paused.

![pause location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg)

### 2\. **Turn off Your Vivo Y100A’s Airplane Mode**

Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.

**For your iOS devices**: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.

![turn on airplane mode on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png)

**For Android** owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network & internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.

![turn on airplane mode on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png)

These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.

### 3\. **Disable GPS Service on Your Device**

Another top method of turning off Life360 is disabling the GPS service on your device. It is an effective option, and you can carry it out on your iOS and Android devices. Below, we’ll break down the steps of doing this on your Android and iOS devices.

**For iOS**

## 8 Solutions to Fix 'Find My Friends Location Not Available' On Vivo Y100A

There is no doubt that Find My Friends is an excellent application for location tracking. It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don't stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you'll know what to do to take care of the problem.

![find my friends location not available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Vivo Y100A ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Vivo Y100A device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Vivo Y100A device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Vivo Y100A device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Vivo Y100A device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Vivo Y100A device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Vivo Y100A device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Vivo Y100A  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Vivo Y100A  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

![enable location services](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg)

### Tip 3: Adjust Vivo Y100A  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

![adjust date and time](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg)

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Vivo Y100A  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

![check internet connection](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg)

### Tip 5: Enable Share My Location

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For Vivo Y100A  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

![enable share my location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg)

Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.

For Android users, go to "Settings" > "Additional settings" > "Privacy" > "Location", and choose the location mode to enable it.

### Tip 6: Restart the Vivo Y100A  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Vivo Y100A  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Vivo Y100A  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Vivo Y100A  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

![restart Vivo Y100A ](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Vivo Y100A .jpg)

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Vivo Y100A device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Vivo Y100A device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.

### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you've faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.
