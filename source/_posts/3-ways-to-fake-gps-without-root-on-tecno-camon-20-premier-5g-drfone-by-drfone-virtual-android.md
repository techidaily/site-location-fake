In this regard, Wondershare Dr.Fone has something special to offer. Its Virtual Location feature, capable of modifying and simulating your location records, can be of great help for you. Don’t worry. It’s very easy to use. Here’s a short guide for you.



- **Step 1:** Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its [<u>official website.</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) Right after, install it on your computer.
