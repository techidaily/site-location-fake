## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Xiaomi 14

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Xiaomi 14

In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups. There are a lot of different situations in which the Circle is useful. Please make sure everything is where it should be. Since Check-Ins, Location Sharing, and Messaging are all exclusive to each Circle, no one who does not need to view a particular piece of information will. You've got the upper hand here. You have complete control over who is and isn't included in your Circle. Privacy is something we take very seriously.

Paying for a Life360 package gives you access to all the Circles. To ensure that everyone in your Circle is able to take advantage of the perks that come with a Life360 Membership, each paid plan for Life360 includes all members in your Circle.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 Circle?

Life360 is a family safety service that offers a variety of services. Its primary focus is to enable families to communicate and stay in touch with each other.

For parents who want to monitor their children from a distance, Life360 is a valuable tool. It is a mapping system that allows your family members to know exactly where you or anybody else in the Family Circle, where Life 360 circle is located at any specified instant, regardless of whether they are in your house or elsewhere.

Since the technology was introduced in 2014, we can safely say that it is no longer considered revolutionary. But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they're going when driving.

## Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?

Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers. With the help of the Life360 Circle function, the mobile application will track your current position in a ring. Those inside that zone may gain insights about where their kid is heading and track any incoming calls or texts from those who may be concerned about their well-being.

As an added feature, the people concerned may determine whether automatic warnings would appear when someone gets to his location without monitoring him further than only displaying where he paused.

The app will notify you as soon as your beloved person comes or departs from a designated place. You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.

## Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?

Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles/bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle's color. The app's primary colors are purple, orange, and green.

It's important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they've been up to.

The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member's recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.

The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.

## Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?

As soon as you've set up your Circle, no one else will be on it. Select "Add a New Member" from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the page, and then forward the recipient a text or email with an invitation key. It will provide instructions to help them acquire the app and join your Circle.

After downloading the app, you'll receive an alert that they have joined your Circle. You'll be able to monitor their activities from then on.

## How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location On Xiaomi 14?

Life360, the app for family and friends, allows you to see where your loved ones are when you open the app. The app shows the current location of your contacts and will tell you the last time they were seen and if they are in an emergency.

However, there's a good chance that you've seen this message multiple times: "Your phone is missing from Life360. Please contact your cellular carrier and try again". This message indicates that your phone is not connected to the internet.

As a result, your contacts, photos, and messages are not showing. Life360 may be using cellular data instead of Wi-Fi, but it's not certain. To avoid this, let us read what we should know.

## Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?

### Interference From Nearby Devices/Networks

In some cases, Life360 may not be able to determine the location of your device because it is being interfered with by other nearby devices or networks. For example, if you have an iPhone or iPad, it may be using the same cell tower as your Xiaomi 14.

The Life360 app has to use the closest available cell tower to determine your location. So if another device uses the closest tower, Life360 will use that instead.

### Poor Signal

A poor signal in a particular region, particularly if you're commuting, is the most common cause of Life360's incorrect location. When your phone is in a poor signal area, the app will use the internet instead of cellular data to determine the location of your contacts.

Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the network lines to determine whether or not this is indeed the source of the problem that prevents your Life360 from being found.

To get more information about how often does life360 update location, read about the Life360: Learn How Everything Works!

## Part 2: How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location Issue?

There are several ways to fix the Life360app problems that life360 not updating its location. Let's check them out one by one.

### Method 1: Review the Internet settings

The weak internet access contributes to the location display's unreliability in life 360. If you notice that life360 is displaying the wrong location, you should examine your Internet connection settings to prevent life360 from displaying an inaccurate location.

Switch off the option that saves power and then turn on the wireless Internet connection.

You may turn off your smartphone's power-saving mode by heading to the status bar and selecting the appropriate option.

![review the internet settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_1.jpg)

Please note that this is just for Android users. Also, do not forget to consider that your Android smartphone's settings may vary from those listed below.

The "switch off low power mode" option may be found in the "Settings"> "Battery" menu on an iOS device.

Android users should also follow this procedure if life360 displays an incorrect location. For battery conservation, numerous programs are disabled when the low power state is engaged.

### Method 2: Double-check Your Current Location in the Settings

If life360 shows the incorrect location, the smartphone's location services significantly come into play. The location settings must be activated to prevent the life360 location issue, and the current program must be updated accordingly.

Scrolling horizontally on the status bar on an Android device is all that is required for consumers to visit the website. Of course, you can also run the software in the background, which may be accomplished in a variety of straightforward but distinct ways based on the Xiaomi 14 device's model.

![double-check your current location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_2.jpg)

You may access the Background App Refresh function by going to the settings menu on your iOS device and selecting "Settings," followed by "General," and then selecting "Background App Refresh." Next, launch the location services function by navigating to "Settings"> "Privacy"> "location services" and selecting "Location Services" from the drop-down menu.

After that, touch on the symbol that represents Life360, as shown below; this will take you to a screen where you may change "Allow Location Access" to "Always" and "Enable Precise Location."

### Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time

Only one device may be used to sign in to the Life 360 app at a time. To prevent the life360 false location problem, log out of all other devices and use just one. When many devices are logged into Life 360 simultaneously, the user's location might be incorrectly determined.

If you want reliable results, you must be logged in from the same device. If you use numerous devices simultaneously to log in to Life360, it will report incorrect location errors for each one. Therefore, it is possible to get inaccurate data. Use a single device to log into life360 to prevent the issue of a wrong location showing up.

## Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?

Two of the most important and easy ways to keep your location on life360 in one place are:

### 1\. Stopping both Wi-Fi and Cellular Data Transmissions

If you disconnect from the internet, Life360 will no longer work, and your last known position will be shown.

Because all other applications are disconnected, this solution has a significant drawback: it prevents alerts, instant messengers, and other applications from working properly. In addition to the fact that you're unable to use the internet, people in your circle will notice something wrong. In addition, it may not be adequate to fake your location.

![stopping both wi-fi and cellular data transmissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_3.jpg)

Those with an iPhone have the advantage of being able to disable the usage of cellular data directly inside the application's settings. However, those with an Android device will need to resort to other approaches.

iPhone users may access the Cellular setting by going to the Settings app and tapping on it. This will switch off the cellular data for the Life360 app. Turn off Life360 by swiping the switch to the off position mentioned above. Life360 will not be able to provide an accurate location report for you so long as there is no Wi-Fi access.

![stopping both wi-fi and cellular data transmissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_4.jpg)

**Advantages:**

- You can use only one device to connect to the internet.
- No need to manually switch between apps.
- You can easily manage all your data.

**Disadvantages:**

- You cannot use other devices at the same time.
- If you lose the connection, you need to reconnect.

### 2\. Faking Your Location

It seems like everyone has their own way to try and fiddle with their location in real life. Some may use satellite images or even old maps and coordinates, while others will buy old phones and ship them to a random location. Whatever your method is, it's probably not the best one out there.

However, a fast but secure option is the use of [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/), which is the best virtual location application right now. You canuse it to change your location to any place on earth.

One of Wondershare's most popular products, Dr. Fone, is a data management and recovery tool. It is compatible with both iOS and Android smartphones, and it comes packaged with a wide variety of control toolkits.

When it comes to faking a location on iOS devices, Dr. Fone- Virtual Location (iOS) is one of the most effective solutions currently available on the market. It is possible to use it to teleport the iOS device to any location in the globe with just one click, and all you have to do is input the address of the place to which you wish to be moved.

Using Dr. Fone-Virtual Location iOS, you can customize your route by selecting how many times you want to go through it and how fast you want to relocate it.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

To free yourself from any hassle, consider using a third-party tool instead, such as Dr.Fone, which will make the entire process super easy and accurate.
