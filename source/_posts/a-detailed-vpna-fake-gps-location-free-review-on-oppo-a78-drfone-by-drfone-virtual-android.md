It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.

Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.

**Social Media**

Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.

**Financial Services**
