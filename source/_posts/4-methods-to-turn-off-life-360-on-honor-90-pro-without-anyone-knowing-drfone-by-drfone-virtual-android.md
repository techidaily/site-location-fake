## Part 1: What is Life 360?

Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch. This tracking app makes it easy to trace the location of your loved ones or anyone you want to track. But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.

![life360 for location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png)

Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.

![life360 map showing circles](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png)

Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency. In addition, the app automatically contacts the emergency contacts you added when you do this. However, this doesn’t change that it can get intrusive when you need some privacy. That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.

### 1\. **Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360**

There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.

- First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.
- Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.

![pause location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg)

### 2\. **Turn off Your Honor 90 Pro’s Airplane Mode**

Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.

**For your iOS devices**: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.

![turn on airplane mode on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png)

**For Android** owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network & internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.

![turn on airplane mode on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png)

These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet.

## How to use Snapchat Location Spoofer to Protect Your Privacy On Honor 90 Pro?

People are very happy about Snapchat’s new Snap map feature. It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.

![snap map feature](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg)

This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.

This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!

## **Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?**

The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?

Yes, Absolutely!

There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.

**Ghost Mode:** The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -

**Step 1:** If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.

![track camera screen](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg)

**Step 2:** On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.

![find bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg)

**Step 3:** The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.

![location setting on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg)

**Step 4:** The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.

![duration ghost mode](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg)

If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.

**Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone**

If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.

**Android**

The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.

**Step 1**: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.

![check location notification tray](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg)

**Step 2**: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on/off.

![tap location on/off](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg)

**iPhone**

To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,

**Step 1:** Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.

![go to setting on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg)

**Step 2:** Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.

![tap privacy option](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg)

**Step 3:** In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.

![click location services option](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg)

**Step 4:** Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.

![turn off location service](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg)

These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location. You must be knowing how to send location on snapchat through chats - even this won’t be possible once you completely turn off the GPS of your devices.

## **Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat**

If you are wondering how to fake location on snapchat, then the Snapchat location spoofer is one of the best options. You won’t find a specific software designed exclusively for Snapchat but Wondershare’s Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer will help you hide your real location on social media apps. This is how you use the application.

[Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

**Step 1**: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it. You will find several options on the page. Go for ‘Virtual Location’.

![dr.fone home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg)

**Step 2**: Now connect Your Honor 90 Pro to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3**: The world map with your current location will show up on the page. The ‘Teleport mode’ is the third icon on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it and enter your new location in the search box.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 4**: Once you’ve decided with your final virtual location to fake gps for snapchat, then click on ‘Move Here’. New location will update in your phone and Snapchat will detect it too.

![set the location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

One of the advantages of using a location spoofer is that - your new location will reflect in all social media applications. Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.

**VPN Service - NordVPN**

The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -

**Step 1**: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.

![nordvpn google play store](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg)

**Step 2**: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.

![signup for quick connect](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg)

**Step 3**: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.

![choose the server](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg)

So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.

## **Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?**

A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.

**Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?**

A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.

**Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?**

A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.

## **Part 4: Conclusion**

Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success. While the location spoofer stands at the top-spot, using a VPN is the next best thing. If you want to rely on in-built features, know that they aren’t always successful. Make the right choice and keep your location a secret for your own privacy.

## Part 4: How to Fake Find My Friends location on Android

If you want to fake Find My Friends location on Android, you can easily configure Android devices to do it. For this, you can take help of an Android spoofer app. There are plenty of them available in Play Store. We will be using “Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer Free”. This is how to fake location on Find My Friends on Android.

**Step 1:** To use this, you don’t need to jailbreak or root your device until your Android is running on 6 and higher versions.

**Step 2:** Go to Play Store and search for the app. Install it after downloading.

When you install it rightly, this is how to do a little twisting to set it up with Find My Friends.

**Step 1:** To spoof people about the location, enable the developer settings in the first place. Simply head to “Settings” for this and go to “About Phone”.

**Step 2:** In the “Software Info”, you will see a build number. Tap on it nearly 6-7 times. The Developers options will be enabled now. This step is important because it will alter the security settings in your phone. As a result, tricking about the location will become easier.

**Step 3:** When developer options are enabled, launch the app. You will see an “ENABLE” option at the bottom. Tap on it to turn on mock locations feature.

**Step 4:** Under the Developer options page, click on “Select mock location app”. Now, select “FakeGPS Free” from the list.

**Step 5:** Return to Fake GPS Free and long press the two spots on map to set the route. Take help of the play button given at the bottom. This will enable the location spoofing. You will see, “Fake location engaged…”. This will show your fake location on Find My Friends app.
