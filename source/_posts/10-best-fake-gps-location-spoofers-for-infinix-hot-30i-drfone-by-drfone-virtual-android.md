To begin, you must download Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS/Android). Install and execute the software after that.

Select "Virtual Location" from the drop-down option to connect your iPhone or Android phone to your PC. From the drop-down option, choose "Get Started" to begin the virtual location function.

If you're playing Pokemon Go on your mobile, connect it to a computer system. When you open the Dr.Fone application, the terms and conditions will be displayed. Read them carefully, accept them, and then click 'Get Started.'

### Step 2: Teleport to any destination

You will be directed to a website that displays a global map as well as your current location on the globe. You may simply zoom in and out to get a better sense of the coordinates and location. 'Teleport Mode' should be selected in the upper right corner of the page.

After that, you can change your current location to wherever you wish to go. This could be as close as a neighboring country or as far away as a different country. If you're playing Pokemon Go, keep it nearby. Then choose 'Move Here.'
