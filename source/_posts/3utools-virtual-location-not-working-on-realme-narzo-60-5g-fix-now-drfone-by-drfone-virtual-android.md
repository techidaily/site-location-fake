## Part 2: Fix 3utools Virtual Location Not Working Issue \[8 ways\]

### 1\. Solving the internet issues

Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.

If this is the cause of your **3uTools virtual location not working**, there isn't much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to "Mapbox" to see if it addresses the problem.

### 2\. Restarting and Closing the Software

When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.

![restart the software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg)

### 3\. 3uTools reinstallation

The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.

![reinstall 3utools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg)

### 4\. Restarting Your Computer

Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.

![restart computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg)

### 5\. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked

When you encounter a 'not working' problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.

![verify the netwrok connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg)

### 6\. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded

Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.

### 7\. Changing the Source Map

Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt "Load embedded maps" to solve this issue.

![load embedded maps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-6.jpg)

Alternatively, change the source map between Google Maps and Open Street Maps.

### 8\. Uninstalling iTunes and rebooting your system

Many customers have reported encountering the "3uTools virtual location developer image load failed" problem, with the majority of them appearing to be iOS 17 users. 3uTools either does not load the location images or the screen becomes frozen.

Remove iTunes from your computer. Then, try restarting it. Install iTunes from the App Store once more. Restart your computer. After that, connect your iPhone to a PC and confirm that it is unlocked.

## Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?

Faking your GPS has its advantages, primarily protecting your privacy.

However, if you're on the receiving end of a fake GPS signal, you need to detect any spoofing attempts before it's too late. You need to have a security measure to ensure data you're receiving is coming from a legitimate source instead of a malicious one. It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.

Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.

**Food Delivery**

Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to.

In addition, a more egregious issue is couriers charging for deliveries that weren't made.

![location spoofing on food delivery driver apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-03.jpg)

**Gaming**

Using GPS spoofing in MMORPGs enables gamers to take advantage of faking their position without moving into the comforts of their own home. This can lead to more in-game rewards that are otherwise difficult to achieve without GPS spoofing.

Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.

**Social Media**

Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.

**Financial Services**

Most financial institutions across the globe use location data to verify users to prevent fraud. Having inaccurate data is a major security beach, especially when handling financial service apps on the internet.

There are various ways to protect yourself from being on the other end of a fake GPS location. You can easily use specialized apps, including [mock location detection APKs](https://apkpure.com/mock-location-root-detector/com.check.mock) if you're on Android. These anti-spoofing GPS apps help detect if someone is providing fake GPS locations. However, if this is not available to you, there are several ways you can mitigate malicious actors by applying some safeguards.

![mock location detection apks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-04.jpg)

Here are some of the methods you can take advantage of.

- Cross-reference location data from multiple sources to detect fake GPS locations. You can cross reference from GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell tower triangulation to analyze accurate GPS.
- Analyze abnormal patterns in location data presented to you from sudden jumps in location or having unrealistic speeds during movement.

- Using a dedicated GPS simulator and comparing results to expected from provided data.
- Have a security measure to detect GPS spoofing apps installed on a user's smartphone.

While the methods to detect GPS locations are presented above, it's important to remember that detecting fake GPS locations is difficult and requires you to combine different methods. You can easily detect mock locations on Android, but the methods available if you're on a different device will vary depending on the resources at your disposal.

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Realme Narzo 60 5G ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Realme Narzo 60 5G device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Realme Narzo 60 5G device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Realme Narzo 60 5G device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Realme Narzo 60 5G device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Realme Narzo 60 5G device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Realme Narzo 60 5G device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Realme Narzo 60 5G  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Realme Narzo 60 5G  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

![enable location services](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg)

### Tip 3: Adjust Realme Narzo 60 5G  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

![adjust date and time](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg)

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Realme Narzo 60 5G  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

![check internet connection](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg)

### Tip 5: Enable Share My Location

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For Realme Narzo 60 5G  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

![enable share my location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg)

Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.

For Android users, go to "Settings" > "Additional settings" > "Privacy" > "Location", and choose the location mode to enable it.

### Tip 6: Restart the Realme Narzo 60 5G  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Realme Narzo 60 5G  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Realme Narzo 60 5G  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Realme Narzo 60 5G  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

![restart Realme Narzo 60 5G ](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Realme Narzo 60 5G .jpg)

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Realme Narzo 60 5G device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Realme Narzo 60 5G device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.

### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you've faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch.

No, you cannot track someone else's Realme Narzo 60 5G  location without their permission. The Find My app only allows you to track the location of devices that are signed in with your Apple ID, and you need the other person's permission to share their location with you.

**4\. Can I prevent someone from tracking my location?**

Yes, you can take steps to prevent someone from tracking your phone's location. Here are some measures you can consider:

1. Turn off location services or GPS.
2. Adjust app permissions.
3. Use airplane mode.
4. Use a VPN or professional location changer tool like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to [change your phone location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-gps-location-ios.html).
5. Check for spyware.
6. Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
7. Review privacy settings.
8. Be cautious with social media.
9. Use encrypted messaging.
10. Avoid public Wi-Fi.
11. Clear location history.

Taking these precautions can help safeguard your phone's location and enhance your privacy. It's important to stay vigilant and be aware of the privacy settings and permissions on your device.
