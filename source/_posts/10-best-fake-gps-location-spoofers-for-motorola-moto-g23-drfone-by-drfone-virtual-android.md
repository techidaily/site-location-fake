## Part 1: How Does Chrome Know Your Location?

Before discussing Google **Chrome's fake location**, it is important to know how Chrome detects your physical location. Google Chrome uses many ways to pinpoint your exact location, like your IP address, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Cell Tower data. Every internet connection has an IP address bound to a location that enables Chrome to identify your location.

Similarly, GPS location can easily be tracked if your phone device has it enabled. All the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections around you also have location information embedded in them. They can help Chrome track you as long as your device can detect them. If you use cell data, Google Chrome can also track you through cell towers.

## Part 2: How to Hide Location Services in Chrome?

If you are worried about Google Chrome detecting your physical location and sharing it with websites and apps, you can hide it easily. The process of hiding your location on Google Chrome is simple, even if you are using multiple devices. Below is the step-by-step process of hiding location services in Google Chrome on computer, Android, and iOS devices.

### Method 1: For Laptop and Desktop PCs

**Step 2:** A window will open on the right side with all the developing tools you can use in Chrome. Click on the three-dots icon located near "Console" in the bottom left corner of the window. Choose "Sensors" from the pop-up menu.

![select the sensors option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-12.jpg)

**Step 3:** Access the newly selected "Sensor" option, and here you can change the browser's location by either selecting a Google's pre-set location or adding your desired location manually. Once the location is selected or added, your browser's location will change.

**Limitations**

- The interface of the Google Chrome DevTools can be very confusing and overwhelming for non-technical users.
- Apart from pre-added locations, it can be hard to add a specific location as your fake location.

### Method 3. Fake Your Location Using Chrome Extension

Many **fake location Chrome extensions** are available on Google Chrome which can be used to alter your location on Chrome. You can find these extensions on Google Chrome Web Store and add them directly to your browser. Below we have explained the steps for using such an extension "[Location Guard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/location-guard/cfohepagpmnodfdmjliccbbigdkfcgia?hl=en)" to fake your location on Google Chrome:

**Step 1:** Open the "Location Guard" on Chrome Web Store and click "Add to Chrome" to add it to your browser. Once the "Location Guard" extension is added, open it and press "Options."

![install the location guard extension](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-14.jpg)

**Step 2:** In the options, you can choose different options like Privacy Levels, Protection Area, and Time for Location Cache. It is recommended you choose a higher level for more protection.

![customize the settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-15.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can also use the "Fixed Location" feature to set up a fake location as a permanent location for your browser. The fixed location can be added by using the market or clicking on the desired place on the map.

![confirm the fixed location position](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-16.jpg)

**Limitations**

- Location Guard doesn't protect your IP address. It means some websites can still detect your real location using the IP address.
- The app is not updated for quite a while, that's why the map of the fixed location feature is quite restricted.

### Method 4. Spoof Your IP Using a VPN Server

Another way you can fool websites and your browser by displaying a **fake location online** is to use a VPN server. VPNs fake your IP address to fool websites and apps into detecting your location. [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) is a VPN that can be used to spoof your IP by following these steps:

**Step 1:** Download and install NordVPN on your computer or phone and log in using your account. If you don't have a NordVPN account, you must create one first.

**Step 2:** If you want to just change the location of your device, you can select "Quick Connect." Using it will enable the program to automatically find the most suited fake location for you.

![tap on the quick connect button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-17.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can also choose the desired location as your fake Chrome location in NordVPN. To do that, scroll down the list of countries and locations and choose your desired locations to connect to.

**Limitations**

- NordVPN can only spoof your IP address and will not work for geo-restricted applications.
- Using a VPN usually affects your internet speed and can make browsing slower and more difficult.

## Part 4: FAQs

### 1.What is Geolocation?

Geolocation is a term used for the process of pinpointing the location of a device connected to the internet. The location can be determined using methods like IP address, GPS, and mobile tower data. Apps and websites commonly use it to provide location-based services.

### 2.What is the HTML5 Geolocation API?

The HTML5 Geolocation API is a browser API used to determine a user's geographical location. Developers use it to build location-aware websites and apps that use users' locations as the basis for providing their services. It can detect location through GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, IP addresses, etc.

### 3.Why should you hide or spoof your Location?

Hiding or spoofing your location protects your privacy and stop application and websites from tracking you. It also allows you to access geo-restricted apps and play location-based games. You can also fake your location to get the latest updates of your favorite apps.

### Conclusion

The fact that Google Chrome in your devices can track your location with an accuracy of up to 20 meters is very unsettling for users. Even when you try to be careful in granting location permissions to apps and websites, many can still bypass this by adding location access requirements in terms and conditions.

That's why having a tool like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to **fake GPS online** is essential nowadays. It can ensure your privacy and helps in protecting you from the dangers of the internet.
