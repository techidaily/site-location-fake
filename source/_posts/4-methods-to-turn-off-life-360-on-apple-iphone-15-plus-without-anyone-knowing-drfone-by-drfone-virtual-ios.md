![pause location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg)

### 2\. **Turn off Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s Airplane Mode**

Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.

**For your iOS devices**: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.

![turn on airplane mode on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png)
