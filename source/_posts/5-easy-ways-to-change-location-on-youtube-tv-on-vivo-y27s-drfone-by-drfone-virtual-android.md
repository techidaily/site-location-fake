## Part 3: User Reviews for Fake GPS Location Pro

Are you still confused about the performance of this location spoofer app? We have provided some user reviews below to help you out:

| Reviewer | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Bobby Nichols | "I was using a different app for quite some time. However, if My Vivo Y27s was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Vivo Y27s sit untouched for an hour..... YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!" |
| Brian Thompson. | "Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren't available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you'd charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user." |
| Gerald | "It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone? Also very sluggish." |

Not in the least. Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer on Vivo Y27s works from the computer and does not affect either the Vivo Y27s or the GPS chip inside the Vivo Y27s. So when you want to come back to your real location, all you need to do is restart the Vivo Y27s.

### FAQ 2: Do I need to jailbreak to use a location spoofer Vivo Y27s app?

Can't say for other apps in the market, but Wondershare Dr.Fone – Virtual Location does not require you to jailbreak your Vivo Y27s. It works using the computer to temporarily change the GPS coordinates of your Vivo Y27s, and you can stop spoofing your location anytime by simply restarting your handset. It does not cause security issues with iOS or risk your privacy at all.

### FAQ 3: Can I jailbreak Vivo Y27s to spoof location using Cydia?

The jailbreakers are only catching up to iOS 15 right now. It is being reported that they are close to jailbreaking iOS 15. As you are running iOS 16, you cannot jailbreak Vivo Y27s to spoof location using Cydia. Furthermore, jailbreaking is not recommended in today's age given the security and privacy risks it poses.

### Conclusion

Location spoofer Vivo Y27s apps are gaining prevalence today mostly among gamers who use these GPS spoofer Vivo Y27s apps to catch more Pokémon. However, anyone can use a location changer on Vivo Y27s for several other benefits such as breaking the geo-restrictions in dating apps and streaming websites to find dates outside your city limits for free and accessing a catalog of movies and TV shows that is not available in your region due to licensing or other considerations. There are several Vivo Y27s location spoofer apps in the market, each extolling its virtues. None of them, however, come close to Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) spoofer on Vivo Y27s given its intuitive interface and ease of use. Not only can you use it on iOS 16 without problem as this app works from a computer, but you also do not have to think about security issues that jailbreaking a device brings because Dr.Fone Virtual Location changer on Vivo Y27s works without jailbreaking the Vivo Y27s.
