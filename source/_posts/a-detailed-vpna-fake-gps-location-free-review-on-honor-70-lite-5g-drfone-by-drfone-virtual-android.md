## Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Honor 70 Lite 5G

PPTP, which stands for Point to Point Tunneling Protocol is one of the oldest and most trusted ways of implementing a VPN. It was developed by Microsoft and uses a GRE tunnel with a TCP control channel to bypass various geo-based restrictions. Since free PPTP VPN has been around for years now and is pretty easy to setup, it is quite popular as well. Read on and learn the basics of PPTP VPN free with a free PPTP VPN list as well.

## Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?

The free VPN PPTP was earlier introduced by Windows, but was later adopted by all the other platforms like Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Even though the layer of encryption in free PPTP VPN is not as secure as other protocols, it makes it pretty fast. Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.
- Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.
- It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.
- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.
- The tunneling is of two types in PPTP â Voluntary and Compulsory. Voluntary tunneling is initiated from the clientâs end while compulsory tunneling is initiated from the serverâs end. Compulsory tunneling should be supported by the router.

After getting to know about so many free PPTP VPN Singapore, USA, Canada, UK, and other countries, you can easily learn how to set up a PPTP VPN free. The process is quite simple and can be implemented in all the leading versions of Windows (and other operating systems). Though, there could be a slight change in the overall interface of the OS you are using. To set up free VPN PPT, follow these steps:

1\. To start with, launch Control Panel and go to the Network and Sharing Center.

2\. From here, you need to select the âSet up a new connection or networkâ option to start the process.
