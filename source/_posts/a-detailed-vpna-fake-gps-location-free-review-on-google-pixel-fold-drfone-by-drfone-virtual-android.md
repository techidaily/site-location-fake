Another reason your phone has the incorrect location would be that your phone is updated to the latest software update. The software update will usually include fixes to the old software update's bugs.

### _Reason #4:_ The “Location Services” might not be enabled for the application

If you have not enabled the application to use the GPS, then it will not show you the correct location. Make sure to check whether this application can access the “Location Services” by following the steps below.

## Part 2: How to Fix Google Pixel Fold Location Accuracy Issue?
