## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus Nord N30 SE ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device, while "Location Not Available" means that the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Nord N30 SE  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus Nord N30 SE  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

![enable location services](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg)

### Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Nord N30 SE  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the OnePlus Nord N30 SE  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

### Tip 5: Enable Share My Location

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For OnePlus Nord N30 SE  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

![enable share my location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.

For Android users, go to "Settings" > "Additional settings" > "Privacy" > "Location", and choose the location mode to enable it.

### Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Nord N30 SE  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for OnePlus Nord N30 SE  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other OnePlus Nord N30 SE  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For OnePlus Nord N30 SE  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

![restart OnePlus Nord N30 SE](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-OnePlus Nord N30 SE .jpg)

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you've faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.

## Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On OnePlus Nord N30 SE?

Life360 is an excellent family security service provider that notifies family members and loved ones about the user's temporary location with GPS tracking and action alerts. In addition, life360 uses texts and notifications to help circle members keep track of everyone's location, driving habits, and frequently visited places. Still, most people don't use the app because they think it restricts them with message tracking and other features that look familiar to some spying apps. For those who want to know does life360 notify when you log out, you will find out everything about that in this article.

Life360 can track your device's location and texts, but it can't read your texts, and people outside your circle can't view your location, so your privacy is safe using this app. All circle members get a location paused notification when logging out or turning off the location. Read till the end to learn how various life360 features work and can you log into life360 on a computer.

## Part 1: How does the life360 location work?

Life360 gives a peace-of-mind to you and your family members by tracking your location, so everyone in your circle knows where is the other person and what are they doing; if the user is driving, then everyone will get a notification about their driving habits, and circle members can check location data history. All the circle members must have the life360 app downloaded and running in the background of their devices. Circle members can see the exact location of the user when the location services are on. Does life360 notify you when you leave a circle? Yes, it sends a notification to all circle members when someone leaves.

Its one-tap location features allow circle members to see everyone's location data on the map. The app gives a route to the other person's current location by tapping any member pointer. If someone is in danger or got an emergency, they can tap the panic button to send a mass text to the circle with their location. The app does not notify when circle members check someone's location history. Life360 notifies circle members when someone turns their location off, text while driving, drive carelessly, or stops the app.

## Part 2: Does life360 notify when you leave?

As the best family locator app, life360 notifies circle members about any user's security or app-related activities. In addition, the app notifies all circle members when someone leaves or is removed from the circle. Does life360 notify when you log in to a new device? Yes, it does. The user can log into multiple devices but only once at a time. As soon as the user changes devices, everyone gets a notification with the new device's location.

There are multiple life160 notifications for different scenarios. Everyone gets a "user removed" notification when a user leaves a circle. As long as the location sharing is on, circle members will get a notification when someone turns their location off. Suppose someone's phone is dead, or there is a poor connection. In that case, life360 puts an exclamation mark next to that user's name to notify other circle members.

## Part 3: How to turn off location on life360 without anyone knowing?

Although life360 provides excellent family location services, it also affects your privacy by tracking your location and texts as long as the phone and location services are on. It is the same for other family tracking apps. For example, suppose users want to attend to some private matters or want others to respect their privacy. The best way is to turn off their location on life360 so no one can track them, but it is not an option because you can't do that on life360. Using a third-party location-changer app is the best solution in this case.

[Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is a location-changer application that allows users to change their device's location with one click. It provides a fake location to all tracking applications like life360 to help users protect their privacy.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Note:** Once you teleport or move to a virtual place, you can restore to the actual location by restarting the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device. You will see a prompt that reminds you to restart your device to restore the location of the connected device when you close the Virtual Location. Click **Restart Device** and close the program.

_\* Dr.Fone Mac version still has the old interface, but it does not affect the use of Dr.Fone function, we will update it as soon as possible._

The Teleport Mode offered in Virtual Location is a great way to change the location of iOS/Android devices. If you wish to show a different location to someone else, the best way is to use this mode on Virtual Location. This can be done by following the steps described below:

Step 1Activate Teleport Mode

Once you have connected your smartphone, continue to select the **Teleport Mode** option from the top-right section. The particular icon is represented by the first icon from the left in that section.
