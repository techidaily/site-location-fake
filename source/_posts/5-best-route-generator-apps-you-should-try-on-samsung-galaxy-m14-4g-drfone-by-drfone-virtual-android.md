![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try

### 6.1 Use a burner phone

If you completely want Life360 to stop you from tracking, the very first method, and indeed a useful one is using a burner phone. This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.

- Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone/Android.
- Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.
- There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.

**Note:** As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.

### 6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings

Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.

**Step 1:** At the lower right corner, hit on "Settings".

![go to Location Sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-2.jpg)

## FAQs

1. **How do I delete my history on Life360?**

While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won't suffice.

2. **Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?**

Yes, it's possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your iPhone without needing to jailbreak the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, users can easily change their GPS location to any desired spot.

3. **How to spoof the actual movement from one place to the fake location?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a tool that allows users to spoof actual movement from one place to another fake location on an iPhone. By using its features, users can simulate movement along a specified route, imitating real-life GPS movement from one location to another.

4.  **If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?**

Disabling Wi-Fi on your iPhone might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device's location services.

## Final Words
