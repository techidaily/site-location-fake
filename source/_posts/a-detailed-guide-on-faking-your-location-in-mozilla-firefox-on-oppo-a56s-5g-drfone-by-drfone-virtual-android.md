## A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On Oppo A56s 5G

Mozilla Firefox is one of the most famous browsers known for its security. Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so **Firefox spoof location** can resolve your concerns.

It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to **fake a location in Firefox** on devices.

![firefox featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox

Before starting with **Firefox location spoof**, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.

### 1\. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API

Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user's location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can't use this API for location determination.

### 2\. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?

HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn't have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Oppo A56s 5G device's location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.

## Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers

Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.

### Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox

If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:

**Step 1:** Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the "Three Vertical Bars" icon to select "Settings." Now, tap "Privacy & Security" from the left sidebar and navigate to "Permissions."

![access privacy and security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Click "Settings" in front of "Location" to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between "Remove Web Site" or "Remove All Web Sites" to remove their location access.

![remove the specific or all websites](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg)

**Step 3:** If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the "Block new requests asking to access your location" option. Once selected, click "Save Changes" to disable your geolocation on Firefox.

![enable the block new option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg)

### Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location

Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That's why it is better to **spoof the location on Firefox** rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:

**Step 1:** Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type "about:config" and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the "Accept the Risk and Continue" button to proceed further.

![hit the accept the risk button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** First search for "Geo.enabled," and when it appears, toggle its value from "True" to "False" to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for "geo.provider.network.url" and press the "Pen" icon to edit it.

![tap on the edit button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:

**"data:application/json,{"location": {"lat": LATITUDE VALUE, "lng": LONGITUDE VALUE}, "accuracy": 27000.0}."**

Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.

![add your fake firefox location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg)

### Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension

Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the "[Location Guard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/)" add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add "Location Guard" and use it to alter your location are following:

**Step 1:** Click on the "Three Vertical Bars" icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select "Add-ons and themes." Tap "Extensions" from the left sidebar and search for "Location Guard" in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click "Add to Firefox" to add it to your browser.

![add the extension to firefox](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can choose between two options to protect your location's privacy. Using the "Privacy Levels" option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.

![set the privacy levels](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg)

**Step 3:** Using its "Fixed Location" feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the "Marker" on it to change your browser's location.

![set the fixed location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones

### Method 1: Disable Geolocation Sharing on the Firefox Browser

**Step 2:** In the "Location" menu, you can select "Never" to completely disable the location access for the Firefox browser. To only stop Firefox from detecting your accurate location, turn off the toggle of the "Precise Location" option.

## iSpoofer is not working On Oppo A56s 5G? Fixed

Pokemon Go is one of the most appreciated games across the world. Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.

![Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg)

However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?

You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.

## **Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?**

If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.

![pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg)

Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.

One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.

![iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg)

iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.

So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.

![iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg)

There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.

## **Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?**

If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Oppo A56s 5G device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.

If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -

**VPNs** - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.

![VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg)

**Apps on App Store** - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.

![App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg)

If you are looking for a sure shot at changing your location without any hassle, then the best suggestion would be to use [Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) Changer. WIthin 3-4 steps you can easily change your location to anywhere in the world. This is how you do it -
