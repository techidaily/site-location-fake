## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Apple iPhone 14 Pro

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try

If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:

1. **Route4Me**

Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices. The app has integrated AI technology that would let you generate optimum routes based on different parameters.

Users can simply search for any location and generate its optimum route from a selected spot.

There are more than 2 million generated routes by its existing users that you can explore.

The GPX file generator would let you save the route for offline viewing or exporting to another app.

5. **GPX Viewer: Tracks, Routes, and Waypoints**

Often considered as the best Pokemon Map Generator, this is a highly resourceful app that is used to generate maps for numerous games. You can also customize specific waypoints that would let you locate Pokemons and other game-related details.

## Part 3: How to View GPX Files Offline on your PC?

As you can see, with the help of a GPX file generator, you can easily save your routes offline. Though, if you are looking for a Pokemon Map Generator app or a solution to view your GPX files on your PC, then try Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS).

I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the best route generator app to meet your requirements. I have listed Pokemon map generator as well as running route generator apps that you can consider. Once you have got a GPX generator, you can also use a tool like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to import/export GPX files and can also use it to play Pokemon Go remotely with its location spoofing feature.



## Will iSpoofer update On Apple iPhone 14 Pro

iSpoofer has been one of the most in-demand applications for changing your location while playing Pokemon Go. For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.

![ispoofer shut down pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg)

All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.

## Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?

![ispoofer not able to log in pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg)

To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.

![Ispoofer error message pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg)

Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.

Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.

![Ispoofer account suspension pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg)

The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far

Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.

## Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?

There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.

**VPNs -** There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.

![VPNs-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg)

Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.

![Google-play-store-apps-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg)

The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -

**Step 1 -** You can use the [Dr.Fone Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html)Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer. You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.

![drfone-change-location-pic-7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg)

**Step 2 -** Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.

![Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg)

**Step 3 -** You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.

![Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg)

**Step 4 -** Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.

As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?

![change-location-registered-pic-10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg)

It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.

## Life360: Learn How Everything Works On Apple iPhone 14 Pro

Nothing is more important than your mobile device when it comes to your security, privacy, and family. Thanks to its easy-to-use features and excellent app, with Life360, your life will be as secure and private as possible.

Whether you're looking to sync photos, videos, contacts, messages, and locations with your mobile devices and computers or simply set up your home cameras to automatically send you alerts, Life360 is designed to be the most powerful mobile phone service provider you've ever seen.

It's the most secure and easiest-to-use service, but it's not the cheapest. So, let's know what Life360 is and how Life360 work.

## Part 1: What Is Life360?

A smartphone software called Life360 tracking system enables families to communicate, track their whereabouts, and get alerts about their loved one's safety and well-being.

When Life360 is installed on the phone, the administrator may create geo-fences specifying certain locations. For example, geo-fences might be employed to monitor family members' arrival and departure times. In addition to that, the program provides driving analysis by means of the Life360 Driver Protect module.

Additionally, BMW has incorporated Life360 into its onboard location tracking. Accident identification and rescue operations are provided through an app that tracks authorized drivers and offers monitoring and analysis.

Both parties need to have the app installed for one to be able to monitor the activities of the other. Using the app, you can see where your phone is at any given moment. A member of your family might know exactly where you are at any given time if they have the app on their phone.

Whether you are currently using the app or not, the Life360 app tracker will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of your mobile device. In addition, you may obtain real-time location information on each other, view it on a hidden map, and even choose to get automatic notifications anytime someone enters or departs a spot, according to the Life 360 website.

Every time a family member departs or comes someplace, an alert is sent to the rest of the family. You can share your location with an adult, and they can see how fast you were driving, how long it took you to come home, and who was home or at school while you were gone.

In addition, adults and children may obtain real-time instructions from a particular family member. For example, you may touch an icon of a family member to receive instructions to that user's location on the Life360 website.

## Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?

Previously, Life360 was criticized for being inaccurate, especially when locating people. However, the company has recently updated its system to ensure that the data it collects is accurate.

The Life360 app uses GPS technology to track your location. When you first install the app, you will be prompted to set up your location. This is done by entering your zip code, city, and state.

You will also be asked to select a default location. This will be used to determine your home address. Once you enter your zip code, city, and state, you will be able to view your location on a map.

Also, Life360 works best in urban areas. If you live in an area with many tall buildings, Life360 may not work as well.

## Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?

Life360 is a relatively new app, but it has been getting attention lately. People are wondering whether it is safe for them to use and whether or not it is worth it.

According to the Life360 website, the app is safe because it is encrypted. The encryption ensures that no one can intercept your communications.

If you are worried about privacy, you can disable the app's location tracking feature. You can also disable the feature if you want to be notified whenever someone enters or leaves a particular area.

You can also use the app without giving anyone else access to your location. You can create a guest profile.

There are no ads or in-app purchases. You do not have to give any information to Life360. You can use the app without giving any information.

Life360 is also very easy to use. You do not need to have any special training to use the app. You simply need to sign up and download the app.

Life360 is available for free on Google Play and Apple App Store.

## Part 5: Can a Location be faked on Life360?

What if You do not want your location to be tracked by someone else? One of the main reasons why people use Life360 is that it allows you to share your location with friends, family, and even strangers. However, if you do not want to be tracked by others, you need to know how to fake your location.

Unfortunately, you cannot spoof your location through Life360, so it is evident that you have to use another way to ensure that no one will know where you are. The easiest solution is an application called [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) which can help you change your location in real-time.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a comprehensive data management desktop software, which helps you to get all your data in one place and protect your important files from being lost. The software is easy to use and compatible with all Android and iOS devices.

You can also remotely wipe sensitive data and settings from any device at any time. With this software, you can backup your contacts, messages, photos, videos, call history, etc., to your PC or to the cloud service. All these features come as part of this.

Setting a virtual location is one of the prime role Dr.Fone plays.

### Steps To Fake Your Location with Dr.Fone Virtual Location

Downloading Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (for iOS or Android) is the first thing that has to be taken. After that, run the executable file to begin using the application.

![access virtual location feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 1:** After going through all of the available choices, choose "Virtual Location," and then connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro or Android phone to your computer. Select "Get Started" from the drop-down menu.

**Step 2:** You may see your current position on a map in the new window. If you are having trouble finding your current position when looking for locations on the map, you may hit the "center on" symbol that is located in the side to the right of the map to reveal your exact location.

![choose destination](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

**Step 3:** Tap the matching icon in the top right to enter "teleport mode." It's as simple as entering your destination location in the top left corner and clicking on the "go" button. Let's look at Rome, Italy, as an illustration of this.

![choose destination you want](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 4:** It's clear to the system that Rome is your destination. To relocate, choose "Move Here" from the menu that appears.

![choose destination you want](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

**Step 5:** Now you're in Rome instead of wherever you were before. Your iOS or Android smartphone will always show Rome, Italy as your location, regardless of where you really are. This is the exact same location that appears in your location-based program.

![tap on move here button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png)

## Part 6: FAQs

### 1\. What are Life360 events?

Although Life360 events are a great way to keep your loved ones informed about your whereabouts, they also provide information about your location, like the weather, time, and date. You can even set an alert when you arrive at a specific location.

For example, if you want to see who is at your house, you can set an event to notify you when someone enters or leaves your home.

### 2\. What does protecting a drive on Life360 do?

Improve your family's driving habits by getting a weekly picture of everyone's driving habits. Gain a comprehensive understanding of the driving patterns of every member of the Circle.

Find out about things like your highest speed and whether or not you text while driving, among other things. Then, take a look at individual drives to find out details such as the exact route taken, the number of kilometers recorded, the peak speed, driving style, and the locations of any driving incidents.

When Circle members are on the road, whether driving, using public transportation, or traveling with companions, keep an eye on their peak speed.

### 3\. Why does life360 show walking instead of driving?

In brief, it is because walking is less likely to be used for commuting than driving. For example, if you live in a rural area, you may not have access to public transportation, and therefore, you would have to walk to work.

### 4\. What does it mean when life360 doesn't update?

It means that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you're using is not connected to the internet. In this case, you should check if your internet connection is working properly. If you're sure your internet connection is working fine, try restarting your device.

### 5\. Does Life360 work when your phone is off?

In the event that you switch off your phone, the GPS feature will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your phone is turned off.

However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data uploaded to your account. So, a life360 login online is necessary.

## Conclusion

Life360 is a useful application that helps you keep tabs on your loved ones. You can track location, receive notifications, and get alerts. But if you want to fake your location, [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is the most recommended product because of its unique features and easy-to-use interface.
