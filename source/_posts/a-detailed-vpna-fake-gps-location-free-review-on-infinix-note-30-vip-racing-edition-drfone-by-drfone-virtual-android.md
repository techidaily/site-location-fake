## Part 3: User Reviews for Fake GPS Location Pro

Are you still confused about the performance of this location spoofer app? We have provided some user reviews below to help you out:

| Reviewer | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Bobby Nichols | "I was using a different app for quite some time. However, if My Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition sit untouched for an hour..... YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!" |
| Brian Thompson. | "Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren't available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you'd charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user." |
| Gerald | "It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone? Also very sluggish." |
