## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Nokia C300

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try

If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:

1. **Route4Me**

Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices. The app has integrated AI technology that would let you generate optimum routes based on different parameters.

Users can simply search for any location and generate its optimum route from a selected spot.

There are more than 2 million generated routes by its existing users that you can explore.

The GPX file generator would let you save the route for offline viewing or exporting to another app.

You can generate up to 10 routes for free and can get its premium version to generate more routes.

## Part 3: How to View GPX Files Offline on your PC?

As you can see, with the help of a GPX file generator, you can easily save your routes offline. Though, if you are looking for a Pokemon Map Generator app or a solution to view your GPX files on your PC, then try Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS).

I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the best route generator app to meet your requirements. I have listed Pokemon map generator as well as running route generator apps that you can consider. Once you have got a GPX generator, you can also use a tool like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to import/export GPX files and can also use it to play Pokemon Go remotely with its location spoofing feature.



## How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Nokia C300?

When you are playing location-based games like Pokemon Go, you might need to simulate GPS movement to catch more Pokemon. To do this, you can use the GPS movement feature of Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). This feature allows you to simulate GPS movement between two or multiple spots on the map. Here's how you can do it:

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

### Part 1: Simulate Movement Along a Route (One-Stop Route)

You can set up a one-stop route when **mocking locations fake** with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This particular feature helps users to set up looping or round trips within a specific location. To perform the steps for simulating movement, look ahead for a better understanding:

Step 1Access One-Stop Route Function

Once you launch Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and connect your smartphone successfully, proceed to select the **One-Stop Route** function from the top-right section. The function is represented by the third icon from the left in the section. While you have already teleported to another location or are using your current location, you can tap anywhere on the map to set your destination location.

![activate one stop route mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Step 2Define Simulation Parameters

Enter a number to define how many times you want to go back and forth, and select whether you want a **Round trip** or a **Loop trip**. Drag the slider on the speed option to set how fast you want to walk. Proceed to click **Move Here** on the bottom to start the movement simulation.

![set parameters to simulate](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

Step 3Start Simulation Movement

The respective simulation starts, and you can see your position is moving on the map with the speed you set. If you wish to hold the simulation, click **Pause** or tap **Clear** to revert to your original state.

![start one stop simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

### Part 2: Simulate Movement Along a Route (Multi-Stop Route)

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve_I4YgjYno" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

You can try the multi-stop mode if you want to pass by multiple places along a route on the map. Learn how it is done when you are trying to **spoof location on Android/**iOS:

Step 1Start Multi-Stop Route and Set Parameters

Activate the **Multi-Stop Route** mode from the top-right section next to the One-Stop Route mode. After activating the mode, set multiple spots on the map by clicking your required place. Define the number of trips and speed. Click **Start Moving** to initiate the process.

**Note:** Select the spots along a specific road to prevent the game developer from thinking you are cheating.

![activate multi stop simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Step 2View Multi-Stop Route Movement

As the simulation starts, click **Pause** at any instance where you want to stop the simulation. You can also **Clear** all settings if required.

![execute multi stop route simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

### Part 3: Use Joystick for More Flexible GPS Control (Joystick Movement)

Dr.Fone has integrated the joystick feature into the Virtual Location program to spare 90% of the labor for GPS control. You can always find the joystick on the lower left part in teleport mode. And you can also click the joystick button in the upper right (the 5th one) to use the joystick feature.

![try joystick movement for simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png)

The joystick, like one-stop route or multi-stop route modes, aims to facilitate GPS movement on the map. But what's better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.

- **Automatic GPS movement:** Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.
- **Manual GPS movement:** Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.

## Best 10 Mock Location Apps Worth Trying On Nokia C300

Location-based apps and games are all the rage right now, and the latest trends indicate that this is not going anywhere but upwards. When you want to access content that is not available to you in your current location, what can you do? Or, when you want to catch Pokémon but aren’t getting any, you can’t give up and stop playing, can you? A location spoofer app to mock location can help you in this situation, and we are going to tell you how to mock location on iPhone and Android along with the top **mock location apps** for Android and iPhone in this guide. Read on!

![top mock location apps for android ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-1.jpg)

## Part I: Purpose of Mock Location Apps

The sole purpose of mock location apps or software is to help users spoof/ mock location to somewhere they are physically not. This may or may not be illegal/ immoral depending on how you use the apps, but who are we to judge! We are here to simply help you with the process.

- Prank your friends and family by showing your location in some other country and have some healthy laughs at their expense!
- Access geographically restricted content such as on streaming platforms. Mocking your location to somewhere where your favorite shows and movies are available helps you watch them from the comfort of your home, wherever in the world that may be!
- If you are an avid Snapchat user, certain filters are only available in certain locations, and you can mock location on iPhone or Android to avail of them.
- Location-based games such as Pokémon GO derive the most benefit from a mock location app because you can change your location and show yourself walking in the streets of London while sipping a mojito at a beach in Hawaii and catching amazing new Pokémon!
- In dating apps, why pay a fee to unlock worldwide access when you can simply use a mock location app to let the dating app change your current location automatically in accordance with your selection in the location spoofer app on your Android or iPhone?

## Part II: Is It Safe to Mock Location? Can It Be Detected?

One of the most frequent and completely understandable concern and question on people’s minds when they talk about location spoofing is whether is it safe to mock location whether it can be detected and what the consequences are.

Answer: Location spoofing is safe and will go undetected as long as it is done sensibly and with the right mock location app on your iPhone and Android. You have nothing to worry about as long as you do not be particularly obvious about location mocking. This means that you should take care not to be hopping like a bunny from here and there in minutes.

## Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone

There are fewer mock location apps on the Apple Store due to Apple's strict policies on user privacy and security. Apple prioritizes maintaining a secure and reliable user experience, which limits the availability of apps that could potentially misuse location data. Therefore, this part will mainly introduce five softwares that need to be installed on a computer. Let’s come to the apps! Here are the top location spoofer apps for iPhone.

#### 1\. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

![drfone virtual location ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location.jpg)

This is by far the best one out there. It is designed professionally and inspires trust, unlike some other apps that neither look as polished nor work as flawlessly. When in doubt, trust Wondershare’s Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to do the job reliably and professionally in just a few clicks.

#### 2\. iTools

![itools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-3.jpg)

iTools by ThinkSkySoft is another great location spoofer you can use. It has an easy-to-understand interface and gets the job done.

#### 3\. iToolab

![itoolab](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-4.jpg)

iToolab is another popular location spoofer for iPhone and comes with some powerful features that you might want. It is continually developed, which means it supports the latest iOS 17 as well.

#### 4\. iMoveGo

![imovego](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-5.jpg)

A quality product from Wootechy, iMoveGo is compatible with the latest iOS 17 and works well for what it does. It does not require jailbreak and comes with a trial version you can use to see what it does and if it fits your purpose.

#### 5\. iSpoofer

![ispoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-6.jpg)

Probably one of the most known apps at one point in time, iSpoofer was great at spoofing location on iPhone until Niantic, the makers of Pokémon GO, detected the app, and banned it. The app still works with some tricks up its sleeve, but we do not really recommend it, given that it was detected once and if you are detected using the app, you will be banned from the Poke-verse for good.



## Part IV: Top Mock Location Apps for Android

Now for the top location spoofer apps on Android OS! Some from above are also compatible with and fully support Android going up to version 14, so you might see duplicates.

#### 1\. GPS Emulator

![gps emulator](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-7.jpg)

GPS Emulator by DigiTools can run on the Android device itself and spoof your location to anywhere in the world. It is easy to use and you can give it a try and see if it suits your needs.

#### 2\. Fake GPS Location-GPS JoyStick

![gps joystick](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-8.jpg)

Fake GPS Location-GPS JoyStick by The App Ninjas is a popular mock location spoofer app on Android. This one provides an overlay joystick control to mock location on Android devices, and it might not be everyone’s cup of tea. Some find the joystick incredibly useful and intuitive while some are downright annoyed by it.

#### 3\. iToolab AnyGo for Android

iToolab AnyGo for Android works in over 100 games and apps and can simulate movements between two points. The speed of movement can be customized and the app does not require you to root your Nokia C300.

#### 4\. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

![drfone virtual location android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-android.jpg)

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location can be used to effectively spoof GPS coordinates on Android devices as well. An issue that other spoofing apps present is that the location might jump between its true location and falsified location, which means that other apps might present a location spoofing solution that is not stable. That is not the case with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android) where a location once set remains set as long as you want it to, and will not jump.



### [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

## Part V: Steps To Mock Location on Android Or iPhone with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location

Dr.Fone is a comprehensive suite of tools made available to you by Wondershare. You might have heard about their other modules and tools such as Dr.Fone - System Repair, Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, Dr.Fone - Data Recovery, etc. Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is the most comprehensive mock location app in the market with features you will be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.

![drfone virtual location device selection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

At this point, instructions change depending on the Nokia C300 device you connected. There are different instructions for iPhone and Android. Please visit [this](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/connect-android-ios-device-to-fake-location.html) link to connect your specific device.

Step 4: After you have connected your respective device, now comes the fun part – spoofing your location! If you want to simply prank your friends or use dating apps and other apps where you simply want a different location, you can use the Jump Teleport mode to simply change your location to anywhere in the world. However, in location-based games, you need to be seen walking or moving around in the environment. In that case, use the One-stop Route mode.

Here’s how to simulate movement using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to play location-based games.

Click the third option from the top right to enter One-stop Route mode. Enter a location to teleport to and click Move Here (1).

Step 5: Click another location or type it and choose from the traveling parameters such as walking, cycling, riding, or driving, and click Move Here as shown below.

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.

## Closing Words

Using a mock location app can be fun. You can use it for recreational purposes such as pranking friends. You can use it for practical purposes such as saving money on dating apps by mocking location on Android and iPhones to anywhere around the world to meet new people. You can use it to simulate movement anywhere in the world in location-based games. You can also use mock location apps to effectively change your geographical location to watch content not available in your true geographical area. Whatever your reason may be, what you need is a reliable mock location app so that you can spoof your location undetected. Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is one such app you can trust with your eyes closed.
