## 4 Methods to Turn off Life 360 On Vivo V30 without Anyone Knowing

Life 360 has made tracking our friends and loved ones so easy. It is an excellent choice for staying updated about family when you have security concerns. Despite this, it can be intrusive when you need your privacy. If you’re a group member and wonder how to turn off Life360 without parents knowing on iPhone and Android devices, you’re in luck. This article will provide you with a complete guide on how to turn off Life 360 without anyone knowing.

## Part 1: What is Life 360?

Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch. This tracking app makes it easy to trace the location of your loved ones or anyone you want to track. But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.

![life360 for location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png)

Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.

![life360 map showing circles](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png)

Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency. In addition, the app automatically contacts the emergency contacts you added when you do this. However, this doesn’t change that it can get intrusive when you need some privacy. That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.

![sending help alert on life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.png)

## Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing

There are times when you want to turn Life360 off without it showing so that people don’t know your present location. But, if you have no idea how to go about it, you’re in luck. This section covers the best methods to stop sharing your location with friends and family on Life360.

### 1\. **Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360**

There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.

- First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.
- Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.

![locate the circle on life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png)

- Tap on ‘location sharing’ and click on the slider next to it to disable location sharing.

![click on location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.jpg)

- Now you can recheck the map, and it will show ‘location sharing paused.

![pause location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg)

### 2\. **Turn off Your Vivo V30’s Airplane Mode**

Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.

**For your iOS devices**: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.

![turn on airplane mode on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png)

**For Android** owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network & internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.

![turn on airplane mode on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png)

These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.

### 3\. **Disable GPS Service on Your Device**
