## A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On Vivo S17t

Mozilla Firefox is one of the most famous browsers known for its security. Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so **Firefox spoof location** can resolve your concerns.

It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to **fake a location in Firefox** on devices.

![firefox featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox

Before starting with **Firefox location spoof**, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.

### 1\. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API

Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user's location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can't use this API for location determination.

### 2\. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?

HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn't have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Vivo S17t device's location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.

## Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers

Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.

### Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox

If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:

**Step 1:** Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the "Three Vertical Bars" icon to select "Settings." Now, tap "Privacy & Security" from the left sidebar and navigate to "Permissions."

![access privacy and security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Click "Settings" in front of "Location" to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between "Remove Web Site" or "Remove All Web Sites" to remove their location access.

![remove the specific or all websites](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg)

**Step 3:** If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the "Block new requests asking to access your location" option. Once selected, click "Save Changes" to disable your geolocation on Firefox.

![enable the block new option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg)

### Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location

Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That's why it is better to **spoof the location on Firefox** rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:

**Step 1:** Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type "about:config" and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the "Accept the Risk and Continue" button to proceed further.

![hit the accept the risk button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** First search for "Geo.enabled," and when it appears, toggle its value from "True" to "False" to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for "geo.provider.network.url" and press the "Pen" icon to edit it.

![tap on the edit button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:

**"data:application/json,{"location": {"lat": LATITUDE VALUE, "lng": LONGITUDE VALUE}, "accuracy": 27000.0}."**

Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.

### Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension

Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the "[Location Guard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/)" add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add "Location Guard" and use it to alter your location are following:

**Step 1:** Click on the "Three Vertical Bars" icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select "Add-ons and themes." Tap "Extensions" from the left sidebar and search for "Location Guard" in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click "Add to Firefox" to add it to your browser.

![add the extension to firefox](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can choose between two options to protect your location's privacy. Using the "Privacy Levels" option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.

![set the privacy levels](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg)

**Step 3:** Using its "Fixed Location" feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the "Marker" on it to change your browser's location.

![set the fixed location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg)

## Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Vivo S17t

PPTP, which stands for Point to Point Tunneling Protocol is one of the oldest and most trusted ways of implementing a VPN. It was developed by Microsoft and uses a GRE tunnel with a TCP control channel to bypass various geo-based restrictions. Since free PPTP VPN has been around for years now and is pretty easy to setup, it is quite popular as well. Read on and learn the basics of PPTP VPN free with a free PPTP VPN list as well.

## Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?

The free VPN PPTP was earlier introduced by Windows, but was later adopted by all the other platforms like Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Even though the layer of encryption in free PPTP VPN is not as secure as other protocols, it makes it pretty fast. Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.
- Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.
- It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.
- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.

## Thinking About Changing Your Netflix Region Without a VPN On Vivo S17t?

Netflix is easily one of the most popular streaming apps available today. It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.

The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you're interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.

![change region without vpn netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg)

## Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions

Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.

Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix's Terms of Use. If you're caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account. This is why you should always take caution when navigating the streaming giant's Terms of Use.

## Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?

If you're wondering if Netflix bans accounts that use VPN, the answer is “No, they don't”. On the other hand, Netflix will block access to content if it detects that you're connected to VPN. If this happens, simply turn off your VPN or try connecting to different servers on your VPN and retry.

## Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?

There are multiple ways to change your location on Netflix without a VPN, whether you're on your computer, iPhone, or Android. You can use a smart DNS service, a Proxy Server, or a [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) to connect to a country you want to access. Follow our guide below to change country on Netflix now without a VPN.

### Method 1: Using a Smart DNS

Utilizing Smart DNS to change country on Netflix without VPN actually works in the same way. This is because Smart DNS re-routes your connection through a server in a different country. Keep in mind that Smart DNS is still a service and will require a subscription from a Smart DNS provider.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different online DNS providers. In this example, you'll see using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

**Step 2**: Register your IP address on your selected provider and obtain the appropriate DNS Server Address on your account.

![change dns server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-dns-server-netflix-1.jpg)

**Step 3**: Open **Networking** settings on your computer, iPhone, PlayStation, or Xbox and find **DNS Settings** (the image below is an example for the Windows system).

![change dns server wifi properties](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-dns-server-netflix-2.jpg)

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address. Click **Ok** once done and restart your computer. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**Pros**

- DNS servers are faster than a usual internet connection, so you can enjoy streaming at high connection speeds.
- DNS Servers don't encrypt your traffic or hide your IP address.

**Cons**

- DNS doesn't carry your information, as the server side will only see the IP address where the query came from, which hackers can manipulate.

### Method 2: Using a Proxy Server

Proxy Servers work the same as VPNs as it routes traffic to a third-party server. However, like DNS, Proxy Servers don't encrypt data but can mask your IP address. Here are the steps to watch NetFlix with a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Search for **Proxy Settings** on your computer.

**Step 2**: Choose between **Automatic** or **Manual proxy setup**.

**Step 3A**: For **Automatic proxy setup**, turn on **Automatically detect settings** and **Use setup script.** Afterward, enter the **Script address** and click **Save.**

**Step 3B**: For **Manual proxy setup,** click **Use a proxy server**. Input **Address** and **Port** numbers. Click **Save** afterward.

**Note**

To change Proxy on mobile phones, change your phone's proxy settings. Your Netflix app will automatically copy your phone's proxy settings if done correctly.

**Pros**

- Proxy Servers mask your IP address retaining anonymity.
- Proxies improve web browsing performance, especially when downloading large files.

**Cons**

- Proxy Servers don't encrypt data.

### Method 3: Using a [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)

For the unfamiliar, Tor is an open-source network that encrypts your connection while stopping trackers from following your activity. Here are the steps to start using Tor Browser to watch Netflix without a VPN.

**Step 1**: Download and install [**Tor Browser**](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

![tor browser for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/tor-browser.jpg)

**Step 2**: Launch **Tor Browser** and click **Connect**.

**Step 3**: Go to **Netflix.com** and log in to your account.

**Note**

Tor Browser is available across all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

**Pros**

- Tor is completely free to use.
- Your browsing history automatically gets deleted.

**Cons**

- You can't control the region you have access to, so your Netflix content is not guaranteed to have what you're looking for.

### Conclusion

Changing your Netflix region with or without a VPN certainly has its perks. This is because you can watch your favorite series unavailable to your country to maximize your streaming access. Choosing a country with a lower subscription price also saves you money.

While it's not illegal to change your Netflix region, it does violate the streaming giant's Terms of Use. You should always research and know the pros and cons when circumventing Netflix's terms so your account doesn't get suspended or terminated.
