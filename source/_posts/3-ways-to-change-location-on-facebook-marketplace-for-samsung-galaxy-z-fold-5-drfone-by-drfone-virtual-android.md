## 8 Solutions to Fix 'Find My Friends Location Not Available' On Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5

There is no doubt that Find My Friends is an excellent application for location tracking. It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don't stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you'll know what to do to take care of the problem.

![find my friends location not available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

![enable location services](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg)

### Tip 3: Adjust Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

![adjust date and time](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg)

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

![check internet connection](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg)

### Tip 5: Enable Share My Location

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

![enable share my location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg)

Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.

For Android users, go to "Settings" > "Additional settings" > "Privacy" > "Location", and choose the location mode to enable it.

### Tip 6: Restart the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

![restart Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 .jpg)

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.

### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you've faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.

**Method 2. [Mock Locations](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.gavrikov.mocklocations)**

Android users can try out the Mock Locations application to spoof their GPS tracker for fake locations on different apps on the phone. It helps change the location coordinates of the user that Network and GPS service providers typically track.

Instead, while using this app, you can set up start and end points for your route on a map and automatically start creating a route between the points.

**Key Features**:

- A simple joystick is available for controlling location and movement when you use this for spoofing.
- Set brakes before any bend in the route.
- Specify closed movement route.
- Set up breakpoints easily.

**Pros**:

- Very lightweight.
- Use the GPX file to replay the route.
- Set up variable speeds.

**Cons**:

- Speed can fluctuate.
- Bugs can occur when users keep it active for longer periods non-stop.

**How to use it?**

**Step 1:** Install the app and launch it. Give app access permissions.

**Step 2**: Long-tap points on the map to mark starting and ending locations. The app will automatically start evaluating suitable routes.

**Step 3:** Click on the confirm tick mark icon. Follow developer permission settings-related steps, and tap on Go.
