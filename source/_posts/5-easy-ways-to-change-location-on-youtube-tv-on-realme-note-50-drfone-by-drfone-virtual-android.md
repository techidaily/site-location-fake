Instead of planning your route a few days in advance, you can find the safest route with just a few taps on your phone, giving you more time to focus on other things.

While using your phone to track your current location, you might have noticed that it is not showing you the correct location. It will confuse you but it does happen from time to time, and there will be fixes that you can do get to track properly. There are also multiple factors that you will need to consider when you encounter an issue where your phone has shown you a completely different location compared to where you are. We will talk about those possible issues and how you can fix them and get them to work properly again.

## Part 1: Why is My Location Wrong on My Realme Note 50?

### _Reason #3:_ Your mobile phone might not be updated

Another reason your phone has the incorrect location would be that your phone is updated to the latest software update. The software update will usually include fixes to the old software update's bugs.

### _Reason #4:_ The “Location Services” might not be enabled for the application

If you have not enabled the application to use the GPS, then it will not show you the correct location. Make sure to check whether this application can access the “Location Services” by following the steps below.

## Part 2: How to Fix Realme Note 50 Location Accuracy Issue?

Now that you know the possible causes of why you have an incorrect location, we will not share with you the fixes that you can do to get a more accurate location when you use your phone.

Similar to your iOS, the application needs to also be updated, so double-check if the application needs to be updated as well. You can do this by going to the App Store and checking if the application needs to be updated and if it does, do update the app and you can retry tracking your location after.

### _Option #4:_ Enable the “Location Services” for your phone
