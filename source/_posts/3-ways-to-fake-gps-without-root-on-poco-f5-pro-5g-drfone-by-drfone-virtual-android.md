Step 6: You are good to go now. The location will be changed as desired. You will see the chosen location fixed whenever you click the "Center On" icon. Also, the same location will be shown in the location-based apps. See, there is no need for any iOS version of VPNa fake GPS apk for the purpose when you have Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&Android).

### Mode 2: Simulate Movement Between two Places

Step 1: You can choose the “One-stop route” i.e. the third icon in the upper right after launching the program.

Step 2: Please opt for the place where you wish to move and you will get aware of that place’s distance.

Step 3: Now, you need to set the speed for how fast you wish to travel. You can choose walk, cycling speed or car speed by sliding the slider given at the bottom. Once done, hit on “Move Here” from the pop-up.

![choose walk, cycling speed or car speed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Step 4: In the next pop-up, you are supposed to enter the number defining the number of times you wish to move between the two places. Once this gets done, click “March”.

![move between the two places](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

### Mode 3: Simulate Movement for Multiple Places

Step 1: In this case, select the fourth icon at the upper right side. This icon denotes the “Multi-stop route”. Subsequently, select the locations one by one from where you want to travel.

Step 2: Note the pop-up box that now comes. It will make you know how far you are going to travel. Choose the moving speed.

![select the locations one by one](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Step 3: The next pop-up will ask you to enter the number for how many times you wish to show back and forth movements. Click “Start Moving” once done.
