## Part 2: Fix 3utools Virtual Location Not Working Issue \[8 ways\]

### 1\. Solving the internet issues

Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.

If this is the cause of your **3uTools virtual location not working**, there isn't much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to "Mapbox" to see if it addresses the problem.

### 2\. Restarting and Closing the Software

When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.

![restart the software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg)

### 3\. 3uTools reinstallation

The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.

![reinstall 3utools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg)

### 4\. Restarting Your Computer

Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.

![restart computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg)

### 5\. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked

When you encounter a 'not working' problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.

![verify the netwrok connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg)

### 6\. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded

Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.

### 7\. Changing the Source Map

Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt "Load embedded maps" to solve this issue.

![load embedded maps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-6.jpg)

Alternatively, change the source map between Google Maps and Open Street Maps.

### 8\. Uninstalling iTunes and rebooting your system

Many customers have reported encountering the "3uTools virtual location developer image load failed" problem, with the majority of them appearing to be iOS 17 users. 3uTools either does not load the location images or the screen becomes frozen.

Remove iTunes from your computer. Then, try restarting it. Install iTunes from the App Store once more. Restart your computer. After that, connect your iPhone to a PC and confirm that it is unlocked.
