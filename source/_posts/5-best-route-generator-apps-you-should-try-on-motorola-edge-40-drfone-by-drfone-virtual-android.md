![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## How to Change Netflix Location to Get More Country Version On Motorola Edge 40

Many people nowadays idle away the hours watching films and TV shows on Netflix. Well, it’s not that hard to see why. First and foremost, Netflix is readily available and easily accessible in different parts of the world. All you have to do is set up an account and browse the selections afterward. Another thing is that Netflix offers a very large catalog of television programs to match your current mood. From romance and adventure to thrillers and documentaries, you will not run out of options. Netflix has got you covered.

At a glance, it looks like the entertainment materials that Netflix has to offer are boundless. Scrolling through its program categories feels like a never-ending loop. But in actuality, there is something important you need to know. Netflix actually provides a different set of movie selections for each region. That means there are certain TV shows and films that are not universally available worldwide. But don’t worry. There are lots of tutorials online on **how to change your location on Netflix.** Surely, one of them can help you gain access to geo-exclusive Netflix content that is currently unavailable in your country.

In this article, we will discuss the main reasons why some Netflix shows are not widely accessible. We will also provide some effective methods on **how to change your Netflix location** on mobile and other electronic devices. Continue reading below to learn more.

## Part 1. Why Netflix Offers Different Shows in Every Country

Netflix is definitely one of the largest video streaming services of our time. It’s currently available in over 190 countries globally. The majority of its content is widely accessible regardless of location. You can binge-watch on them anytime and anywhere so long as their individual broadcast license remains active. But as mentioned earlier, there are some Netflix shows that are not available worldwide.

There are many potential reasons why Netflix shows vary from one region to another. One of them is cultural influence. Of course, Netflix prioritizes the screening of shows that are highly relatable for the target audience. Hence, the content available in certain locations is locally sourced or regionally concentrated. But that’s not all. There are other reasons why Netflix offers different shows in every country. Check out the list below to understand it better.

### The theme of the Netflix show contradicts certain government rules or traditional beliefs

![banned netflix shows](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-1.JPG)

Netflix holds traditional beliefs in high regard and abides by government rules. If the show depicts sensitive topics that certain countries don’t openly discuss, its viewing is immediately restricted in the region. That’s probably the reason why a particular Netflix show is unavailable in your region. Is there a way to access it without traveling anywhere? Luckily, there is. Find a tutorial online on how to change your location on Netflix. Follow the steps accordingly until your Netflix location is modified. After that, the restricted show must be available now on your end.

### There are some issues regarding copyright ownership

![netflix shows copyright](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-2.JPG)

In simple terms, copyright ownership is enforced separately in each country. That means Netflix must secure individual licenses for every region. Sometimes, certain countries fail to acquire copyright ownership due to the cost and other factors. As a result, the content becomes unavailable in that particular location. We cannot do anything about it unless you’re willing to shell out money for the license. But if you’re really eager to get hold of the restricted Netflix show, try to modify your device’s primary location. Don’t worry. There are many tutorials online on how to change your Netflix location. Just choose one and follow the instructions indicated.

### The Netflix show has varying release dates for each region

![netflix show release date](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-3.JPG)

Maybe there is no complicated issue behind the geo-blocking of a particular Netflix show in your region. It’s possible that the release date is actually different in every country. If that’s the case, there is nothing to worry about. It’s just another marketing tactic to add an element of surprise for the fans. All you have to do now is sit back and wait as patiently as you can. If you’re too excited to be counting down the days, you may try to alter the location settings on your device. Find the most suitable guide on how to change your location on Netflix.

## Part 2. How to Change Your Netflix Region?

If you wish to explore other Netflix collections, the best way you can try is to alter your Netflix region. Is it possible? Of course, it is. There are many tutorials that provide easy steps on how to change your Netflix region. If you successfully complete them, your Netflix location will be changed immediately as though you’ve traveled somewhere. Don’t worry. Most of them are not that complicated to implement. In actuality, it only takes a few minutes or even seconds to accomplish the entire instructions. Just make sure to choose the best guide that works perfectly with your situation. To help you out, below is the list of methods you can try.

### Method 1: Activate VPN before streaming Netflix shows

Virtual Private Networks generally mask your IP address by directing your internet traffic to a server from a different location. Thus, your location settings show modified coordinates whenever you browse the internet with a VPN enabled. That also works with streaming Netflix shows that are currently restricted in your region. Do you want to try it? Here’s a short guide on how to change your location on Netflix using Virtual Private Networks.

- **Step 1:** First and foremost, check the current standing of your Netflix account and make sure it is active. Once confirmed, choose your preferred VPN.

![active netflix account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-4.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Then, download and install your selected Virtual Private Network. Register an account afterward and subscribe to a paid plan if necessary.
- **Step 3:** Activate the VPN on your device. From there, choose a country where you wish to direct your internet traffic.

![connect to vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-5.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Once successfully activated, you can now access Netflix on your device and search for the restricted TV show you want to watch.

### Method 2: Stream Netflix shows with a web proxy server

For the most part, a web proxy server basically works like a Virtual Private Network. It reroutes your internet traffic to a particular server from a different location. Through this tactic, Netflix fails to detect that you’re using its service from a restricted region. A web proxy server is often free of charge. Thus, it’s a great alternative to VPNs if you don’t want to spend money just to access unavailable content on your device. Do you want to try it now? Here’s how to change your Netflix location using a web proxy server.

- **Step 1:** Choose your preferred web proxy server and then visit its official website. Create an account if necessary.
- **Step 2:** After that, select a server from the available options. Make sure that the server you’re going to choose is not geologically blocklisted on Netflix.

![select a server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-6.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Enter the official web address of Netflix into the URL bar and then proceed immediately.
- **Step 4:** Wait while the web proxy server is loading up your request. After a few minutes, the Netflix dashboard must be displayed on your computer screen. From there, you can now browse its catalog and binge-watch the content currently restricted in your region. That’s exactly how to change your location on Netflix with a web proxy server.

![stream netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-7.jpg)

### Method 3: Stream Netflix shows from the Tor browser

Tor browser is primarily used for ultra-private internet browsing. Your online activities on this platform are encrypted and directed to about three various servers located worldwide. Although you cannot actually change your location settings, your actual IP address will be masked and routed somewhere else. This way, you get a higher chance of accessing restricted Netflix shows from the comfort of your own home. Do you want to try it now? Here’s the guide on how to change your Netflix region using the Tor browser.

- **Step 1:** Download Tor browser from its [<u>official website.</u>](https://www.torproject.org/download/) After that, install it on your computer.
- **Step 2:** Launch the Tor browser on your desktop and hit **Connect.** Make sure that Tor has been successfully configured on your device. Once confirmed, visit the official website of Netflix.

![connect to tor](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-8.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Browse through the wide content selections on Netflix dashboard and find the restricted content you want to watch.

## Part 3. Things to Remember When Modifying Location Settings For Netflix Streaming

The tutorials above on how to change your location on Netflix are undeniably helpful for many people. The three of them are effective in this regard, depending on your situation. However, don’t forget that engaging in this kind of modification entails some risk. That’s why you should be careful and vigilant when you decide to implement the methods above. To understand it better, check out the list below.

![stream netflix safely](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-9.JPG)

- Avoid using VPNs or web proxy servers with unverified origin. You never know. Instead of providing solutions, these illegitimate tools might cause serious problems on your end. It’s better to pay for a subscription if it’s going to help you secure your usage.
- According to some users, Tor browsers run too slow. If you’re not patient enough, you might struggle to stream Netflix shows on this platform. That’s why you only resort to this option if all available alternatives have been exhausted.
- Take note that Virtual Private Networks sometimes downgrade the network bandwidth. As a result, internet speed gets affected, and data transmission slacks off than usual. If you cannot stand this kind of scenario, it’s best to tick off the use of VPN from your list of options.
- It rarely happens, but there is a possibility that data breaches might occur. That’s why you should first check the security protocols that VPNs and web proxy servers implement. Make sure that their data protection is powerful enough to keep your personal information safe and private.
