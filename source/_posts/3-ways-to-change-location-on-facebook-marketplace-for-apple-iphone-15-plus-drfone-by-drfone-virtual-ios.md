As of now, you cannot run **_Life360 on computer_** as it is only available for Android and iOS. _Why?_ Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.

However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the **_Life360 app for Windows_**. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the **_Life360 app on Windows_**.

However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.

In this situation, you can simply run the **_Life360 app on PC_**. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.

Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.

## Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?

Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.

The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.

However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and **_run the app on a Windows PC_**. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.
