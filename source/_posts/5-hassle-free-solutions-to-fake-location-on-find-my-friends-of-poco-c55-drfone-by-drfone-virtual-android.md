### Method 1: Share location on Facebook Messenger via Live Location

How to share my location on Messenger? Well, the first option you can try is through Live Location. It works best if you wish to tell somebody where exactly you are and give updates from time to time. Don’t worry. Although it looks complicated at a glance, in reality, it’s actually not rocket science. It only takes a few seconds to complete. Below is a tutorial on how to share Live Location on Messenger in easy steps.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Facebook Messenger** application on your mobile device.
- **Step 2:** Browse through your conversation feed and find the contact with whom you wish to share your Live Location. Click on it.
- **Step 3:** Click the **More (+)** icon at the bottom-left corner of the screen.

### Method 2: Share location on Facebook Messenger via Pinned Location

Let’s say there is a specific place you want to visit with your friend. Is there a way to share the address of the venue without you being there at the moment? Fortunately, it is possible. Apart from sharing your current location in real-time via Live Location, you can also send pinned locations on Messenger. You just need to search for it and then redirect the details to your friend. Yes. It’s just as simple as that. Do you want to try it on your smartphone? If so, follow the guide below.

- **Step 1:** Launch the **Facebook Messenger** application on your mobile device.
- **Step 2:** Scroll through your conversations and find the receiver from the list. Click on it.
- **Step 3:** On the text field, click the **More (+)** icon at the bottom-left corner.
- **Step 4:** Then, click **Location.**
- **Step 5:** Locate the search bar above the interactive map and type in the location you want to share.

![search location on messenger](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-10.jpg)

- **Step 6:** Choose one from the suggested results and then click on it. The details will then be forwarded immediately to the intended receiver.

### Method 3: Share location on Facebook Messenger via Google Maps location

How do I share my location in Messenger if I cannot find it on the map provided? Yes. That happens sometimes. There are certain places that are untraceable on the messaging platform. As a result, it doesn’t appear on the map when you try to search for it. But don’t sweat it. If you experience the same issue, you can instead use Google Maps to share location details. How to do it? Check out the tutorial provided below.

- **Step 1:** Launch the **Google Maps** application on your mobile device.
- **Step 2:** Click on the **Search** bar at the top and then type in the location.

![google maps search bar](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-11.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Choose one from the suggestions and then tap on it. Make sure that it is exactly what you’re looking for.

![location choices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-12.jpg)

![share google maps location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-13.jpg)

- **Step 6:** Find the receiver from the provided list and then click the **Send** button next to its name.

![send google maps location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-14.jpg)
