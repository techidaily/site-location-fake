## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try

You can watch the baseball matches on different streaming websites, including Peacock, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, Sling TV, etc.

### **3\. Can MLB TV detect VPN?**

No, the MLB TV will not be able to detect the VPN because VPN masks your location and hides your real identity from everyone on the internet. The only condition is that the IP address provided by the VPN service should not be included in the MaxMind database.

Regional blackouts are based on the physical location of the user. Therefore, if you want to see the teams that are subjected to the blackout at your location, you should enter the ZIP code of your area on MLB.com.
