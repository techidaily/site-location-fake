## Part 6: How to Stop Life360 from Tracking you

### 6.1 Use a burner phone

If you completely want Life360 to stop you from tracking, the very first method, and indeed a useful one is using a burner phone. This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.

- Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone/Android.
- Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.
- There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.

**Note:** As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.

### 6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings

Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.

**Step 1:** At the lower right corner, hit on "Settings".

## FAQs

1. **How do I delete my history on Life360?**

While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won't suffice.

2. **Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?**

Yes, it's possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your iPhone without needing to jailbreak the Poco X5 Pro device. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, users can easily change their GPS location to any desired spot.

3. **How to spoof the actual movement from one place to the fake location?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a tool that allows users to spoof actual movement from one place to another fake location on an iPhone. By using its features, users can simulate movement along a specified route, imitating real-life GPS movement from one location to another.

4.  **If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?**

Disabling Wi-Fi on your iPhone might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device's location services.

## Final Words

Life360 is no doubt a useful app that can help you know about the whereabouts of your near friends and family. However, when you hate being tracked on it, spoofing Life360 can come out as a great option.

### See What Fake GPS location - Hola's Users Have to Say

Hola Fake GPS location has mixed reviews from users. Here's what users have to say about the Hola Fake GPS application:

**Vikas Divyakirti on G2 Says:**

"Hola Fake GPS is a great service for anyone looking for a simple and location-changer application. The interface is really simple to use, and the time spent on the app is always a seamless experience. The security features offered are not that top-notch, but if you are looking for a free application just to change your location, then Hola Fake GPS is the way to go."

**Sheron on G2 Writes:**

"Hola Fake GPS has been a disappointing experience for me, and I'm pretty sure it will be for you. The attractive pricing and fast speed promise seem like it is the best location spoofer on the internet, but believe me, any other service on the internet is better than this. The company now constantly gets negative feedback from the giants like Google for its privacy violation. Overall, I would ask you not to download Hola Fake GPS app."

## Part 4. Is Fake GPS location - Hola Safe?

No. There is no grey area here. For years, the Hola Fake GPS Android app has been marked as one of the worst apps to change your location. It explicitly collects users' data, monitors users' activity, and sells them to third-party vendors that track you online.

## Bonus Tips: How to Use HolaVPN and a Location Spoofer to Fake GPS on Pokémon?

Pokémon Go is hugely popular, but some countries block players from accessing certain features or from downloading it at all. A free VPN service, HolaVPN, can be used to change your IP location to unblock Pokémon Go in these areas.

### 1\. What is HolaVPN?

HolaVPN is a VPN service that reroutes your internet traffic and hides your IP address. Unlike the Hola Fake GPS, the bandwidth and encryption levels allotted with the HolaVPN service are significant. Plus, it does not alter the location of a chosen application but all the applications on the internet. This means you can play Pokémon from any part of the world, access YouTube from another region, and so on.

### 2\. Why Use HolaVPN in Pokémon Go?

Various situations might prompt you to use HoleVPN in the Pokemon Go game. For example, some countries restrict players from downloading the Pokemon Go game or gaining full access to some in-game features. Also, some Schools and organizations' networks usually restrict players from playing the Pokemon Go game, so you need a VPN to be able to access the game.

### 3\. How to use a HolaVPN with Pokémon Go?

**Step 1.** Download the HolaVPN app on your device. Then, launch it and sign in to or create an account.

**Step 2.** Spoofing your GPS location on Android or iPhone requires a third-party app. Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is one of the best GPS spoofing apps.

**Step 3**: Locate the country you wish to change your location to and tap on it.

**Step 4:** Once you're connected to a particular country, your phone location will change instantly.

### In conclusion

Hola Fake GPS location is not the best application to change your GPS location. But if you are simply looking to access a restricted website because of IP location, HolaVPN can be helpful.

However, it is unsuitable for long-time use. For instance, Hola Fake GPS is known to monitor your online activity and collect information about you. So, it is best to use an advanced application like the Dr.Fone - Virtual Location as shown. As mentioned, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location uses the most advanced technology to spoof your GPS location, so apps like Pokémon Go can't find your actual GPS location.

Overall, if you are looking for the ultimate tool to spoof your GPS location, then [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is the best way to go.
