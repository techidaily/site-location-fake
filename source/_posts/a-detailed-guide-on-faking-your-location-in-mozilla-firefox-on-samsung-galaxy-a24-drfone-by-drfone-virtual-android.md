## A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On Samsung Galaxy A24

Mozilla Firefox is one of the most famous browsers known for its security. Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so **Firefox spoof location** can resolve your concerns.

It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to **fake a location in Firefox** on devices.

![firefox featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox

Before starting with **Firefox location spoof**, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.

### 1\. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API

Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user's location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can't use this API for location determination.

### 2\. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?

HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn't have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Samsung Galaxy A24 device's location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.

## Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers

Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.

### Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox

If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:

**Step 1:** Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the "Three Vertical Bars" icon to select "Settings." Now, tap "Privacy & Security" from the left sidebar and navigate to "Permissions."

![access privacy and security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Click "Settings" in front of "Location" to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between "Remove Web Site" or "Remove All Web Sites" to remove their location access.

![remove the specific or all websites](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg)

**Step 3:** If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the "Block new requests asking to access your location" option. Once selected, click "Save Changes" to disable your geolocation on Firefox.

![enable the block new option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg)

### Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location

Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That's why it is better to **spoof the location on Firefox** rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:

**Step 1:** Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type "about:config" and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the "Accept the Risk and Continue" button to proceed further.

![hit the accept the risk button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** First search for "Geo.enabled," and when it appears, toggle its value from "True" to "False" to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for "geo.provider.network.url" and press the "Pen" icon to edit it.

![tap on the edit button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:

**"data:application/json,{"location": {"lat": LATITUDE VALUE, "lng": LONGITUDE VALUE}, "accuracy": 27000.0}."**

Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.

### Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension

Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the "[Location Guard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/)" add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add "Location Guard" and use it to alter your location are following:

**Step 1:** Click on the "Three Vertical Bars" icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select "Add-ons and themes." Tap "Extensions" from the left sidebar and search for "Location Guard" in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click "Add to Firefox" to add it to your browser.

![add the extension to firefox](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can choose between two options to protect your location's privacy. Using the "Privacy Levels" option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.

![set the privacy levels](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg)

**Step 3:** Using its "Fixed Location" feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the "Marker" on it to change your browser's location.

![set the fixed location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg)

## Will iSpoofer update On Samsung Galaxy A24

iSpoofer has been one of the most in-demand applications for changing your location while playing Pokemon Go. For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.

![ispoofer shut down pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg)

All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.

## Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?

![ispoofer not able to log in pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg)

To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.

![Ispoofer error message pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg)

Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.

Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.

![Ispoofer account suspension pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg)

The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far

Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.

## Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?

There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.

**VPNs -** There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.

![VPNs-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg)

Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.

![Google-play-store-apps-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg)

The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -

**Step 1 -** You can use the [Dr.Fone Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your Samsung Galaxy A24 (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer. You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.

![drfone-change-location-pic-7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg)

**Step 2 -** Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.

![Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg)

**Step 3 -** You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.

![Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg)

**Step 4 -** Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.

As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?

![change-location-registered-pic-10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg)

It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.
