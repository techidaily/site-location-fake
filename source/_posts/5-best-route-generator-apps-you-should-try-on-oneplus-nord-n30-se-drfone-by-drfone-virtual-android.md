![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 2: Urgent FAQ about Fake Location on Hulu

### Q1. How to Fix a VPN Not Working with Hulu?

At times, even after connecting with a VPN, it may not work with Hulu and the user might get a message saying “you appear to be using an anonymous proxy tool”. The easiest and the simplest solution to this problem is by disconnecting from the present server and trying with a new one.

You can also clear the cache on your system and restart to again try connecting Hulu with

VPN. Some of the other solutions that might work include taking the help of the VPN support team, checking for IP and DNS leaks, disabling IPv6, or using a different VPN protocol.

### Q2. How to Bypass Hulu Error Codes?

While connecting Hulu using a VPN, you may encounter several errors like errors 16, 400, 406, and others with each of them having different issues like connection, account, server, and more. Depending on the type of type and meaning of the error, you can try bypassing and fixing it.

For Hulu errors 3 and 5 that are regarding connection issues, you can try to restart the streaming device and also restart your router. For error 16 that shows invalid region issues, you need to use a VPN that can help you bypass the region blocks of Hulu. Some of the other possible ways to fix different code error issues include reinstalling or updating the Hulu app, checking the internet connection, removing the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device from the account, and adding it again.

### Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?

Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – **Hulu home location**. The home location will apply to all the OnePlus Nord N30 SE devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.

Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.

So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.

![home location error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg)

To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you **remove home location errors**:

**Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router**

Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.

**Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer**

Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.

### Final Words

To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device. For spoofing GPS on your mobile devices,Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, works as an excellent tool.
