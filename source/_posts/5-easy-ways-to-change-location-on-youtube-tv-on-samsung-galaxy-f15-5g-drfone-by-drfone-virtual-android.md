Life360 gives a peace-of-mind to you and your family members by tracking your location, so everyone in your circle knows where is the other person and what are they doing; if the user is driving, then everyone will get a notification about their driving habits, and circle members can check location data history. All the circle members must have the life360 app downloaded and running in the background of their devices. Circle members can see the exact location of the user when the location services are on. Does life360 notify you when you leave a circle? Yes, it sends a notification to all circle members when someone leaves.

Its one-tap location features allow circle members to see everyone's location data on the map. The app gives a route to the other person's current location by tapping any member pointer. If someone is in danger or got an emergency, they can tap the panic button to send a mass text to the circle with their location. The app does not notify when circle members check someone's location history. Life360 notifies circle members when someone turns their location off, text while driving, drive carelessly, or stops the app.
