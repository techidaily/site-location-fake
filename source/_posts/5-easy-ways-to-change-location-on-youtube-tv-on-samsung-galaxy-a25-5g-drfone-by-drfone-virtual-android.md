**Step 3**: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.

![identify yourself](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg)

**Step 4**: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config --global user.email "[<u>you@example.com</u>](mailto:you@example.com)" and git config --global user. name "your name".You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.

**Step 5**: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Samsung Galaxy A25 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.

![iphone connects to mac](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg)

**Step 6**: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the 'Build Device' option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Samsung Galaxy A25 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.

![process-detection-on-iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg)

**Step 7**: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu > Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Samsung Galaxy A25 5G as well.

## Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy A25 5G using Cydia Location Faker App

Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don't know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia's LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.

**Step 1**: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.

![cydia app download](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg)

**Step 2**: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.

![enter new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg)

**Step 3**: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from 'OFF' to 'ON' at the bottom of the page.

![cydia toggle shift](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg)

**Step 4**: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an 'i' icon. Go click on it and choose the 'White List' option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone's location.

## Part 5: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A25 5G using Location Handle

Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -

**Step 1**: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store

![location handler cydia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg)

**Step 2**: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.

![teleport-coordination](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg)

**Step 3**: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.

![manual mode location handle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg)

**Step 4**: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.

![chowchilla location handler](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg)

**Step 5**: The Joystick will appear on the page and you can use it to shift your location to wherever you want. Once you fix on the location, proceed and the new location will be updated.
