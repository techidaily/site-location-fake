You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can't deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

### FAQ 1: Will a location spoofer Vivo S18 Pro app damage my Vivo S18 Pro or its GPS?

Not in the least. Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer on Vivo S18 Pro works from the computer and does not affect either the Vivo S18 Pro or the GPS chip inside the Vivo S18 Pro. So when you want to come back to your real location, all you need to do is restart the Vivo S18 Pro.
