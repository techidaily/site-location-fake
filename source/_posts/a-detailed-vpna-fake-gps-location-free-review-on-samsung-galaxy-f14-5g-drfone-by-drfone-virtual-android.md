## Can Life360 Track You When Your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G is off?

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

Did you know that your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G tracks your location even when turned off? And if you're a member of any social media network, it means you could be tracked. Do you like to have your privacy? Do you want to protect your kids from being tracked by strangers?

Of course Yes! Well, then you should know that Your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G can track your movements even when switched off. But is that true?

In the event that you switch off your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G, the GPS function will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G is turned off. However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data that was uploaded to your account.

Should we trust Life360, the social media company that recently merged with Google, to protect our privacy? Let's take a look at the facts.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?

The one app that kids hate and parents adore is called Life360. Life360 is monitoring software that can be downloaded into your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G and used by the individuals who are part of your Family Circle to monitor your location and the location of anybody else who is part of your Family Circle.

The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers. In addition, life360 will store your location and send it to your social networks automatically.

Life360 is not required to track your location, but it is required to send your location to your social networks.

If you want to know more about Life360, check out our Life360 Review.

When it comes to privacy, many people are becoming more aware of how it is being violated. As a result, there's no need to worry about whether or not the monitoring app in concern is as trustworthy as Life360.

Disconnecting from Life360 is as simple as turning off your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G and preventing the app from following and reporting your every step. Unfortunately, it also means that no one can see where they are about one another or how long it has been since they last updated their position.

If the necessity ever arose, such an undertaking may be useful for maintaining one's privacy. However, customers have no idea that Life 360 may still be used to monitor them by other people.

Premium users will still have access to the last 30 days' worth of location data, so the other person will be able to see where you were last seen.

### 1\. Low Data Consumption

Disabling Life360's Wi-Fi and Data may result in a warning to parents that their children are offline so that they can keep an eye on their kids. Does life 360 drain the battery? Low data mode is a better option for turning off life360 without alerting your parents. Go to the Settings and locate Life360; however, do not deactivate the exact location.

### 3\. Setting Wi-Fi and Data Services to "Off."

Another typical method kids use to prevent their parents from monitoring their position is to disable Life360's Wi-Fi and Data. It works like this. If you don't want applications updating in the background, enable power-saving mode.

Use a wired connection. Adolescents can turn off Wi-Fi and data when using the Life360 app on an iPhone. Go to Settings, look for Life360, and disable Cellular Data, Background Refresh, and Motion & Fitness. You'll be able to keep track of where you are on Life360.

## Part 2: Urgent FAQ about Fake Location on Hulu

### Q1. How to Fix a VPN Not Working with Hulu?

At times, even after connecting with a VPN, it may not work with Hulu and the user might get a message saying “you appear to be using an anonymous proxy tool”. The easiest and the simplest solution to this problem is by disconnecting from the present server and trying with a new one.

You can also clear the cache on your system and restart to again try connecting Hulu with

VPN. Some of the other solutions that might work include taking the help of the VPN support team, checking for IP and DNS leaks, disabling IPv6, or using a different VPN protocol.

### Q2. How to Bypass Hulu Error Codes?

While connecting Hulu using a VPN, you may encounter several errors like errors 16, 400, 406, and others with each of them having different issues like connection, account, server, and more. Depending on the type of type and meaning of the error, you can try bypassing and fixing it.

For Hulu errors 3 and 5 that are regarding connection issues, you can try to restart the streaming device and also restart your router. For error 16 that shows invalid region issues, you need to use a VPN that can help you bypass the region blocks of Hulu. Some of the other possible ways to fix different code error issues include reinstalling or updating the Hulu app, checking the internet connection, removing the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device from the account, and adding it again.

### Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?

Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – **Hulu home location**. The home location will apply to all the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.

Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.

So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.

To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you **remove home location errors**:

**Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router**

Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.

**Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer**

Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.
