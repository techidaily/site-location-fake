Not in the least. Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer on Infinix Note 30 works from the computer and does not affect either the Infinix Note 30 or the GPS chip inside the Infinix Note 30. So when you want to come back to your real location, all you need to do is restart the Infinix Note 30.

### FAQ 2: Do I need to jailbreak to use a location spoofer Infinix Note 30 app?

It works using the computer to temporarily change the GPS coordinates of your Infinix Note 30, and you can stop spoofing your location anytime by simply restarting your handset. It does not cause security issues with iOS or risk your privacy at all.

### FAQ 3: Can I jailbreak Infinix Note 30 to spoof location using Cydia?

The jailbreakers are only catching up to iOS 15 right now. It is being reported that they are close to jailbreaking iOS 15.

Furthermore, jailbreaking is not recommended in today's age given the security and privacy risks it poses.
