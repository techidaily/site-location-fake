## Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G?

Airplane mode is a feature available on all smartphones and other electronic devices that stops the signal transmissions from the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G devices. Also known as flight or airplane mode, this feature will disconnect the wireless functions, including cellular connection, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

![airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/airplane-mode.jpg)

The feature's name says that it was introduced to cut off any radio transmission during the flight to avoid any communication interference. However, the feature must be enabled while taking a flight, and if you need to be disconnected from the signals, you can even use the feature outside the plane.

If you have **enabled airplane mode on your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G** or Android device and think it will also block your GPS location, you are wrong. Know why airplane mode does not turn off GPS location and other ways to **avoid getting tracked with or without Airplane Mode.**


## Part 1: Does Airplane Mode Turn off location?

As we mentioned above, while you put your phone on airplane mode, the cellular radio, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is disabled, but not the GPS location.

The GPS works on a different technology where the signals are received from the satellite and are not dependent on the network or cellular services. So, when the airplane mode is enabled, the GPS location is not turned off.

## Part 2: Can Your Location Be tailed on Airplane Mode?

Yes, if you have not disabled the GPS feature, your location can be tailed on an Airplane mode as the flight mode only disables the cellular connection and Wi-Fi. So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode is no solution for stopping the GPS tracking on your phone, though there are other workarounds available for this.

## Part 3: How to Prevent Phones from Being Tailed?

The GPS feature of your phone, besides assisting you, is also a way any person or third-party app can keep track, which can hamper your privacy and be annoying. So, for privacy or any other reason, if you are looking for ways to prevent your phones from being tailed, check out the solutions for iDevices and Android below.

### 3.1. How to stop GPS tracking on Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5Gs?

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-1.jpg)

**Step 2**. Enable the Airplane Mode or turn off the Wi-Fi and Cellular icon.

**Step 3**. Next, you need to disable the GPS radio. On some of the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G devices, there is a separate setting for this. Go to Settings > Privacy> Location Services. The list of the apps using the location services will appear. Move the toggle at the Location Services to turn it off.

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-2.jpg)

## Part 5: People Also ask about Airplane Mode

### Q1: Can An iPhone Be Traced While off?

No, it cannot be traced when an iPhone or any other phone is switched off. For example, when an iPhone is switched off, its GPS is not activated, and thus it cannot be traced.

### Q2: Does Find My iPhone Work on Airplane Mode?

No, the Find My iPhone feature does not work in Airplane mode because the location services need a network connection, and thus in Airplane mode, the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device is offline, and it isn't easy to track the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device.

### Q3: Does airplane mode turn off life360

Life360 is a helpful app for tracking your friends, family, and other people. This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during **airplane mode, Life360** will not update your site.

## Wrap it up

So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi. Therefore, to stop getting traced, you need to disable your location services along with the airplane mode. Using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an excellent alternative to stop the GPS location as the software will help you set a fake location, and your actual location will remain hidden from all.

## Can Life360 Track You When Your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G is off?

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

Did you know that your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G tracks your location even when turned off? And if you're a member of any social media network, it means you could be tracked. Do you like to have your privacy? Do you want to protect your kids from being tracked by strangers?

Of course Yes! Well, then you should know that Your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G can track your movements even when switched off. But is that true?

In the event that you switch off your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G, the GPS function will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G is turned off. However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data that was uploaded to your account.

Should we trust Life360, the social media company that recently merged with Google, to protect our privacy? Let's take a look at the facts.

- [Part 2: Does life360 work if the phone is off?](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off.html#Part2)

## Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?

The one app that kids hate and parents adore is called Life360. Life360 is monitoring software that can be downloaded into your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G and used by the individuals who are part of your Family Circle to monitor your location and the location of anybody else who is part of your Family Circle.

The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers. In addition, life360 will store your location and send it to your social networks automatically.

Life360 is not required to track your location, but it is required to send your location to your social networks.

If you want to know more about Life360, check out our Life360 Review.

When it comes to privacy, many people are becoming more aware of how it is being violated. As a result, there's no need to worry about whether or not the monitoring app in concern is as trustworthy as Life360.

Disconnecting from Life360 is as simple as turning off your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G and preventing the app from following and reporting your every step. Unfortunately, it also means that no one can see where they are about one another or how long it has been since they last updated their position.

If the necessity ever arose, such an undertaking may be useful for maintaining one's privacy. However, customers have no idea that Life 360 may still be used to monitor them by other people.

Premium users will still have access to the last 30 days' worth of location data, so the other person will be able to see where you were last seen.

## Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You

### 1\. Low Data Consumption

Disabling Life360's Wi-Fi and Data may result in a warning to parents that their children are offline so that they can keep an eye on their kids. Does life 360 drain the battery? Low data mode is a better option for turning off life360 without alerting your parents. Go to the Settings and locate Life360; however, do not deactivate the exact location.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

Alternatively, you should disable background app refresh, mobile network, physical activity, and WIFI to save battery life. An issue with your Internet connection will come up instead of location stopped in this situation. So don't connect to any Wi-Fi at all.

### 2\. Fake Locations

Using location spoofing applications on an Android smartphone, your kids can fool you into thinking they're somewhere else. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is a location spoofing application that will trick you into thinking that you are in a different location than you really are. The GPS position of the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device will be updated to reflect the new place that you have chosen thanks to the software. It is worth noting that Dr. Fone - Virtual Location for iOS may also enable you to imitate GPS movement.

It has several other noticeable features that can help you in your daily life.

![access virtual location feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

### 3\. Setting Wi-Fi and Data Services to "Off."

Another typical method kids use to prevent their parents from monitoring their position is to disable Life360's Wi-Fi and Data. It works like this. If you don't want applications updating in the background, enable power-saving mode.

Use a wired connection. Adolescents can turn off Wi-Fi and data when using the Life360 app on an iPhone. Go to Settings, look for Life360, and disable Cellular Data, Background Refresh, and Motion & Fitness. You'll be able to keep track of where you are on Life360.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

All these methods can be used to Stop Life360 from Tracking You. However, the best all-in-one solution is a third-party application called Dr.Fone. This Virtual Location Software helps you keep your tracking off, but you can also fake your location very easily in minutes.

### Conclusion

Can you track a phone if the location is off? Life360 has become a standard feature of many smartphones. Parents often use it to monitor their children's location.
