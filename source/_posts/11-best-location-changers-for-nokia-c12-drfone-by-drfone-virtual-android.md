### Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool

At first, you can just connect your iPhone to your computer and launch the Dr.Fone toolkit. Select the "Virtual Location" feature from its home and click on the "Get Started" button.

### Step 2: Look for a location to spoof

The application will automatically detect your device's location and would display it. To change it, click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top, and enter the address/coordinates of the place in the search bar.

### Step 3: Change your iPhone's location

After entering the target location, the interface would also change. You can move the pin, zoom in/out, and drop it to the designated place. In the end, just click on the "Move Here" button to spoof your iPhone's location.

This brings us to the end of this detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free review. To help you use the VPNa Fake GPS APK, I have listed its features, pros, cons, and even a detailed tutorial. On the other hand, if you are an iPhone user, then you can simply use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) and change your device's location to anywhere you want.
