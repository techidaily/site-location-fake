## Part 2: Fix 3utools Virtual Location Not Working Issue \[8 ways\]

### 1\. Solving the internet issues

Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.

If this is the cause of your **3uTools virtual location not working**, there isn't much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to "Mapbox" to see if it addresses the problem.

### 2\. Restarting and Closing the Software

When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.

![restart the software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg)

### 3\. 3uTools reinstallation

The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.

![reinstall 3utools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg)

### 4\. Restarting Your Computer

Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.

![restart computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg)

### 5\. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked

When you encounter a 'not working' problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.

![verify the netwrok connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg)

### 6\. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded

Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.

### 7\. Changing the Source Map

Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt "Load embedded maps" to solve this issue.

![load embedded maps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-6.jpg)

Alternatively, change the source map between Google Maps and Open Street Maps.

### 8\. Uninstalling iTunes and rebooting your system

Many customers have reported encountering the "3uTools virtual location developer image load failed" problem, with the majority of them appearing to be iOS 17 users. 3uTools either does not load the location images or the screen becomes frozen.

Remove iTunes from your computer. Then, try restarting it. Install iTunes from the App Store once more. Restart your computer. After that, connect your iPhone to a PC and confirm that it is unlocked.

## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Honor X9a

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go.

## Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On Honor X9a?

Life360 is an excellent family security service provider that notifies family members and loved ones about the user's temporary location with GPS tracking and action alerts. In addition, life360 uses texts and notifications to help circle members keep track of everyone's location, driving habits, and frequently visited places. Still, most people don't use the app because they think it restricts them with message tracking and other features that look familiar to some spying apps. For those who want to know does life360 notify when you log out, you will find out everything about that in this article.

Life360 can track your device's location and texts, but it can't read your texts, and people outside your circle can't view your location, so your privacy is safe using this app. All circle members get a location paused notification when logging out or turning off the location. Read till the end to learn how various life360 features work and can you log into life360 on a computer. We also have solutions to turn off locations without others knowing on any family tracking app.

## Part 1: How does the life360 location work?

Life360 gives a peace-of-mind to you and your family members by tracking your location, so everyone in your circle knows where is the other person and what are they doing; if the user is driving, then everyone will get a notification about their driving habits, and circle members can check location data history. All the circle members must have the life360 app downloaded and running in the background of their devices. Circle members can see the exact location of the user when the location services are on. Does life360 notify you when you leave a circle? Yes, it sends a notification to all circle members when someone leaves.

Its one-tap location features allow circle members to see everyone's location data on the map. The app gives a route to the other person's current location by tapping any member pointer. If someone is in danger or got an emergency, they can tap the panic button to send a mass text to the circle with their location. The app does not notify when circle members check someone's location history. Life360 notifies circle members when someone turns their location off, text while driving, drive carelessly, or stops the app.

## Part 2: Does life360 notify when you leave?

As the best family locator app, life360 notifies circle members about any user's security or app-related activities. In addition, the app notifies all circle members when someone leaves or is removed from the circle. Does life360 notify when you log in to a new device? Yes, it does. The user can log into multiple devices but only once at a time. As soon as the user changes devices, everyone gets a notification with the new device's location.

There are multiple life160 notifications for different scenarios. Everyone gets a "user removed" notification when a user leaves a circle. As long as the location sharing is on, circle members will get a notification when someone turns their location off. Suppose someone's phone is dead, or there is a poor connection. In that case, life360 puts an exclamation mark next to that user's name to notify other circle members.

## Part 3: How to turn off location on life360 without anyone knowing?

Although life360 provides excellent family location services, it also affects your privacy by tracking your location and texts as long as the phone and location services are on. It is the same for other family tracking apps. For example, suppose users want to attend to some private matters or want others to respect their privacy. The best way is to turn off their location on life360 so no one can track them, but it is not an option because you can't do that on life360. Using a third-party location-changer app is the best solution in this case.

[Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is a location-changer application that allows users to change their device's location with one click.
