## Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Honor 90 GT

PPTP, which stands for Point to Point Tunneling Protocol is one of the oldest and most trusted ways of implementing a VPN.

Since free PPTP VPN has been around for years now and is pretty easy to setup, it is quite popular as well. Read on and learn the basics of PPTP VPN free with a free PPTP VPN list as well.

## Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?

The free VPN PPTP was earlier introduced by Windows, but was later adopted by all the other platforms like Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Even though the layer of encryption in free PPTP VPN is not as secure as other protocols, it makes it pretty fast. Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.
- Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.

- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.

Step 6: You are good to go now. The location will be changed as desired. You will see the chosen location fixed whenever you click the "Center On" icon. Also, the same location will be shown in the location-based apps. See, there is no need for any iOS version of VPNa fake GPS apk for the purpose when you have Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&Android).

### Mode 2: Simulate Movement Between two Places

Step 1: You can choose the “One-stop route” i.e. the third icon in the upper right after launching the program.

Step 2: Please opt for the place where you wish to move and you will get aware of that place’s distance.

Step 3: Now, you need to set the speed for how fast you wish to travel. You can choose walk, cycling speed or car speed by sliding the slider given at the bottom. Once done, hit on “Move Here” from the pop-up.

![choose walk, cycling speed or car speed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Step 4: In the next pop-up, you are supposed to enter the number defining the number of times you wish to move between the two places. Once this gets done, click “March”.

Step 5: The simulation of the movement will now begin and you can track the position being moved with the selected mode of speed.

### Mode 3: Simulate Movement for Multiple Places

Step 1: In this case, select the fourth icon at the upper right side. This icon denotes the “Multi-stop route”. Subsequently, select the locations one by one from where you want to travel.

Step 2: Note the pop-up box that now comes. It will make you know how far you are going to travel. Choose the moving speed.

![select the locations one by one](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Step 3: The next pop-up will ask you to enter the number for how many times you wish to show back and forth movements. Click “Start Moving” once done.
