## Bonus Tips: How to Use HolaVPN and a Location Spoofer to Fake GPS on Pokémon?

Pokémon Go is hugely popular, but some countries block players from accessing certain features or from downloading it at all. A free VPN service, HolaVPN, can be used to change your IP location to unblock Pokémon Go in these areas.

### 1\. What is HolaVPN?

HolaVPN is a VPN service that reroutes your internet traffic and hides your IP address. Unlike the Hola Fake GPS, the bandwidth and encryption levels allotted with the HolaVPN service are significant. Plus, it does not alter the location of a chosen application but all the applications on the internet. This means you can play Pokémon from any part of the world, access YouTube from another region, and so on.

### 2\. Why Use HolaVPN in Pokémon Go?

Various situations might prompt you to use HoleVPN in the Pokemon Go game. For example, some countries restrict players from downloading the Pokemon Go game or gaining full access to some in-game features. Also, some Schools and organizations' networks usually restrict players from playing the Pokemon Go game, so you need a VPN to be able to access the game.

### 3\. How to use a HolaVPN with Pokémon Go?

**Step 1.** Download the HolaVPN app on your device. Then, launch it and sign in to or create an account.

**Step 2.** Spoofing your GPS location on Android or iPhone requires a third-party app. Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is one of the best GPS spoofing apps.

**Step 3**: Locate the country you wish to change your location to and tap on it.

**Step 4:** Once you're connected to a particular country, your phone location will change instantly.

### In conclusion

Hola Fake GPS location is not the best application to change your GPS location. But if you are simply looking to access a restricted website because of IP location, HolaVPN can be helpful.

However, it is unsuitable for long-time use. For instance, Hola Fake GPS is known to monitor your online activity and collect information about you. So, it is best to use an advanced application like the Dr.Fone - Virtual Location as shown. As mentioned, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location uses the most advanced technology to spoof your GPS location, so apps like Pokémon Go can't find your actual GPS location.

Overall, if you are looking for the ultimate tool to spoof your GPS location, then [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is the best way to go.
