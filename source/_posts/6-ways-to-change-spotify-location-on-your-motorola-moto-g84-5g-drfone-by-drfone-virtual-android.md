![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Spotify’s booming audio business is proof that people are in love with its services. If you want to listen to your favorite retro song, or you want to discover the latest hits, Spotify has everything. You can also listen to some really good podcasts and album hits. But what most of us don’t know is that your Spotify Location can determine what kind of content you might come across on the platform.

Your playlist suggestions depend on the country and region you are staying in. And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.

## **Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify**

Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.

**Region Specific Content**

![region specific spotify content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg)

The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.

**Geo-Based Suggestions**

![sopify playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg)

Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.

**But is Spotify available everywhere?**

How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.

The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.

## **Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone**

Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content. To make that possible, you can use some of the best online tools to fake spotify location whenever you want. Instead of going for the regular Spotify Update Location, you can use these third-party applications to change the location on your iPhone devices (will reflect in Spotify too).

The Wondershare’s Dr. Fone is a very good application that lets you change location Spotify with a few easy steps. It hardly takes a few minutes and this is how you go about it-

## Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Motorola Moto G84 5G

PPTP, which stands for Point to Point Tunneling Protocol is one of the oldest and most trusted ways of implementing a VPN. It was developed by Microsoft and uses a GRE tunnel with a TCP control channel to bypass various geo-based restrictions. Since free PPTP VPN has been around for years now and is pretty easy to setup, it is quite popular as well. Read on and learn the basics of PPTP VPN free with a free PPTP VPN list as well.

## Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?

The free VPN PPTP was earlier introduced by Windows, but was later adopted by all the other platforms like Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Even though the layer of encryption in free PPTP VPN is not as secure as other protocols, it makes it pretty fast. Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.
- Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.
- It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.
- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.
- The tunneling is of two types in PPTP – Voluntary and Compulsory. Voluntary tunneling is initiated from the client’s end while compulsory tunneling is initiated from the server’s end. Compulsory tunneling should be supported by the router.

Though, there could be a slight change in the overall interface of the OS you are using. To set up free VPN PPT, follow these steps:

1\. To start with, launch Control Panel and go to the Network and Sharing Center.

2\. From here, you need to select the “Set up a new connection or network” option to start the process.

3\. This will launch a new wizard that can be used to setup a PPTP VPN free. Out of all the provided options, select the “Connect to a workplace” option.

![connect to a workplace](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-3.jpg)

4\. On the next window, you would be given an option to either dial directly or use a VPN. Click on the “Use my Internet Connection (VPN)” option to continue.

![Use my Internet Connection ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-4.png)

5\. Great! Now, you need to provide information related to the host and server. You can refer the free PPTP VPN list we have provided in the previous section and pick the server (and hostname) of your choice.

6\. As you would proceed to the next window, you need to provide the username and password of the PPTP VPN free you are using. The same can be obtained from our free PPTP VPN list.

7\. In the end, just click on the “Create” button to use your VPN. It will be listed under the available networks.

8\. Sometimes, we have to change Network Settings to make it work. To do this, just select the VPN you have created and visit its Properties.

![change nerwork settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-5.jpg)

9\. Go to the Security tab and make sure the type of VPN is listed as PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol). Also, the data encryption option should be “Optional Encryption (Connect even if no encryption)” and the option for “Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)” should be selected for “Allow these protocols”.

![pptp vpn properties](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-6.jpg)

10\. Furthermore, you can go to the General tab to make sure the server is specified correctly.

11\. Once it is done, you can save these changes and exit the interface. Now, go to the list of available networks and connect to the free PPTP VPN you have created.

![connect to free pptp vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-7.png)

That’s it! By following these steps, you would be able to create a free PPTP VPN Singapore, USA, UK, Canada, Germany, or any other location. Simply give this tutorial a try and pick the preferred option from our free PPTP VPN list. If you also have a suggestion for a free VPN PPTP that you want to add to your list, then let us know about it in the comments below.
