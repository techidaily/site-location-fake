Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place.

## Part 6: How to Stop Life360 from Tracking you

### 6.1 Use a burner phone

If you completely want Life360 to stop you from tracking, the very first method, and indeed a useful one is using a burner phone. This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.

- Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone/Android.
- Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.
- There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.

**Note:** As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.

### 6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings

Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.

**Step 1:** At the lower right corner, hit on "Settings".

![settings of Life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, go to the Circle Switcher at the top and pick out the circle you wish not to share locations with.

**Step 3:** Hit on "Location Sharing".

![go to Location Sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Lastly, toggle off the slider and it will turn grey. You will see a message saying "Location Sharing Paused" and you are done.

![pause location sharing for Life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-3.jpg)

**Note:** When you disable or pause location for a particular group, your location can still be tracked by other circles. Make sure to choose all or as per your needs.

## FAQs

1. **How do I delete my history on Life360?**

While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won't suffice.

2. **Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?**

Yes, it's possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your iPhone without needing to jailbreak the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, users can easily change their GPS location to any desired spot.

3. **How to spoof the actual movement from one place to the fake location?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a tool that allows users to spoof actual movement from one place to another fake location on an iPhone. By using its features, users can simulate movement along a specified route, imitating real-life GPS movement from one location to another.

4.  **If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?**

Disabling Wi-Fi on your iPhone might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device's location services.

## Final Words

Life360 is no doubt a useful app that can help you know about the whereabouts of your near friends and family. However, when you hate being tracked on it, spoofing Life360 can come out as a great option. We discussed some helpful ways **how to fake your location on Life360** in this article, including [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) which allows you to manipulate your GPS location, simulate routes, and set up geofences, making it a versatile solution for your location spoofing needs. Hope you find this helpful.

### 2\. **Turn off Your Lava Blaze Pro 5G’s Airplane Mode**

Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.

**For your iOS devices**: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.

**For Android** owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network & internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.

![turn on airplane mode on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png)

These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.
