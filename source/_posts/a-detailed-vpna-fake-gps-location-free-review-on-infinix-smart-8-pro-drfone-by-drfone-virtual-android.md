You can also give invitations to other users by simply taking the help of their contact numbers or email addresses.

![life360 app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/life360-intro.jpg)

## Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?

Unarguably Life360 can be considered one of the most helpful and fun apps. But the thing that sometimes or many times might bother people is the 24x7 interference with privacy.

For instance, spouses can monitor their better half and if any one of them does not understand enough, they can put various questions for your particular location and it may create chaos as a result. Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place.

But what goes best? You might be wondering the same. For many of you, simply stopping the app and logging out from it can be a plain solution. However, we don’t support this. To us, the faking location on Life360 is much better.

- This is because firstly, if you log out and completely stop using the app, your members will get a notification for the same. To this, their curiosity will arise and none of them will stop questioning from you. To avoid this, we suggest spoofing Life360 location and not stopping it.
- Secondly, this may be fun as you can show off to your friends that you are traveling somewhere else. The list of friends may include those who are jealous of you. And this is the best way to double up their jealousy.

## Part 6: How to Stop Life360 from Tracking you

### 6.1 Use a burner phone

If you completely want Life360 to stop you from tracking, the very first method, and indeed a useful one is using a burner phone. This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.

- Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone/Android.
- Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.
- There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.

**Note:** As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.

### 6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings

Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.

**Step 1:** At the lower right corner, hit on "Settings".

**Step 3:** Hit on "Location Sharing".

![go to Location Sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Lastly, toggle off the slider and it will turn grey. You will see a message saying "Location Sharing Paused" and you are done.

## FAQs

1. **How do I delete my history on Life360?**

While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won't suffice.

2. **Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?**

Yes, it's possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your iPhone without needing to jailbreak the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device.

4.  **If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?**

Disabling Wi-Fi on your iPhone might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device's location services.

## Final Words

Life360 is no doubt a useful app that can help you know about the whereabouts of your near friends and family.
