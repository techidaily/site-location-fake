## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Motorola Razr 40

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try

If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:

1. **Route4Me**

Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices. The app has integrated AI technology that would let you generate optimum routes based on different parameters.

Users can simply search for any location and generate its optimum route from a selected spot.

There are more than 2 million generated routes by its existing users that you can explore.

The GPX file generator would let you save the route for offline viewing or exporting to another app.

You can generate up to 10 routes for free and can get its premium version to generate more routes.

_Runs on_: iOS and Android

Price: Free or $9.99

2. **Routes: GPX KML Generator**

5. **GPX Viewer: Tracks, Routes, and Waypoints**

## Part 3: How to View GPX Files Offline on your PC?

As you can see, with the help of a GPX file generator, you can easily save your routes offline. Though, if you are looking for a Pokemon Map Generator app or a solution to view your GPX files on your PC, then try Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS). Developed by Wondershare, it can be used to view GPX files, spoof the location of your device, and even simulate its movement.

- You can create a route between multiple spots and export it as a GPX file from the application.
- There is an option to directly import GPX files on your computer and monitor the routes.
- You can simulate the movement of your device between multiple spots at a preferred speed.
- There is an inbuilt joystick that would let you move naturally on the map.

I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the best route generator app to meet your requirements. I have listed Pokemon map generator as well as running route generator apps that you can consider. Once you have got a GPX generator, you can also use a tool like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to import/export GPX files and can also use it to play Pokemon Go remotely with its location spoofing feature.



## How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Motorola Razr 40?

When you are playing location-based games like Pokemon Go, you might need to simulate GPS movement to catch more Pokemon. To do this, you can use the GPS movement feature of Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). This feature allows you to simulate GPS movement between two or multiple spots on the map. Here's how you can do it:

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

### Part 1: Simulate Movement Along a Route (One-Stop Route)

You can set up a one-stop route when **mocking locations fake** with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This particular feature helps users to set up looping or round trips within a specific location. To perform the steps for simulating movement, look ahead for a better understanding:

Step 1Access One-Stop Route Function

Once you launch Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and connect your smartphone successfully, proceed to select the **One-Stop Route** function from the top-right section. The function is represented by the third icon from the left in the section. While you have already teleported to another location or are using your current location, you can tap anywhere on the map to set your destination location.

![activate one stop route mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Step 2Define Simulation Parameters

Enter a number to define how many times you want to go back and forth, and select whether you want a **Round trip** or a **Loop trip**. Drag the slider on the speed option to set how fast you want to walk. Proceed to click **Move Here** on the bottom to start the movement simulation.

![set parameters to simulate](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

Step 3Start Simulation Movement

The respective simulation starts, and you can see your position is moving on the map with the speed you set. If you wish to hold the simulation, click **Pause** or tap **Clear** to revert to your original state.

![start one stop simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

### Part 2: Simulate Movement Along a Route (Multi-Stop Route)

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve_I4YgjYno" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

You can try the multi-stop mode if you want to pass by multiple places along a route on the map. Learn how it is done when you are trying to **spoof location on Android/**iOS:

Step 1Start Multi-Stop Route and Set Parameters

Activate the **Multi-Stop Route** mode from the top-right section next to the One-Stop Route mode. After activating the mode, set multiple spots on the map by clicking your required place. Define the number of trips and speed. Click **Start Moving** to initiate the process.

**Note:** Select the spots along a specific road to prevent the game developer from thinking you are cheating.

![activate multi stop simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Step 2View Multi-Stop Route Movement

As the simulation starts, click **Pause** at any instance where you want to stop the simulation. You can also **Clear** all settings if required.

![execute multi stop route simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

### Part 3: Use Joystick for More Flexible GPS Control (Joystick Movement)

Dr.Fone has integrated the joystick feature into the Virtual Location program to spare 90% of the labor for GPS control. You can always find the joystick on the lower left part in teleport mode. And you can also click the joystick button in the upper right (the 5th one) to use the joystick feature.

![try joystick movement for simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png)

The joystick, like one-stop route or multi-stop route modes, aims to facilitate GPS movement on the map. But what's better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.

- **Automatic GPS movement:** Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.
- **Manual GPS movement:** Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.
