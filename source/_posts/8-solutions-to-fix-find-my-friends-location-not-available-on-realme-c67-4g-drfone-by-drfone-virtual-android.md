## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Realme C67 4G ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Realme C67 4G device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Realme C67 4G device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Realme C67 4G device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Realme C67 4G device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Realme C67 4G device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Realme C67 4G device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Realme C67 4G  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

### Tip 3: Adjust Realme C67 4G  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem.

Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

![adjust date and time](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg)

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Realme C67 4G  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

![check internet connection](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg)

### Tip 5: Enable Share My Location

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For Realme C67 4G  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

![enable share my location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg)

Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.

For Android users, go to "Settings" > "Additional settings" > "Privacy" > "Location", and choose the location mode to enable it.

### Tip 6: Restart the Realme C67 4G  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Realme C67 4G  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Realme C67 4G  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Realme C67 4G  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

![restart Realme C67 4G](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Realme C67 4G .jpg)

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Realme C67 4G device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Realme C67 4G device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.

### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you've faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch.

### Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?

Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – **Hulu home location**. The home location will apply to all the Realme C67 4G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.

Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.

So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.

![home location error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg)

To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you **remove home location errors**:

**Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router**

Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.

**Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer**

Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.

### Final Words

To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device. For spoofing GPS on your mobile devices,Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, works as an excellent tool.
