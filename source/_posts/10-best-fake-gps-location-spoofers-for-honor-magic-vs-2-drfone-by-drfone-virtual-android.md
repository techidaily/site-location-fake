Faking your GPS has its advantages, primarily protecting your privacy.

Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.

**Social Media**

Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.

If you are using Life360 as a rudimentary spyware to track your ex or any such purposes, then that is on you and that is an invasion of their privacy.

## Conclusion

I hope reading this article helped relieve your concerns about the Life360 app. Can you track text messages with life360 "Yes" the app tracks your location through texts but can life360 read texts, or can life360 see who you text, "No" because it cannot monitor all your device's actions. The device can see if you are texting others. Still, it cannot store any data, so you can privately communicate with people inside or outside your circle. But you can stop the app from tracking your location for safety purposes, so you have to use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to trick location-based applications or change your GPS coordinates or location history with one click.
