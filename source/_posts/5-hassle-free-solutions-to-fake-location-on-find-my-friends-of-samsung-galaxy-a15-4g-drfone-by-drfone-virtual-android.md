Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.
- **Manual GPS movement:** Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard.

## Part II: Is It Safe to Mock Location? Can It Be Detected?

One of the most frequent and completely understandable concern and question on people’s minds when they talk about location spoofing is whether is it safe to mock location whether it can be detected and what the consequences are.

#### 1\. Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)

This is by far the best one out there. It is designed professionally and inspires trust, unlike some other apps that neither look as polished nor work as flawlessly. When in doubt, trust Wondershare’s Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to do the job reliably and professionally in just a few clicks.

A quality product from Wootechy, iMoveGo is compatible with the latest iOS 17 and works well for what it does. It does not require jailbreak and comes with a trial version you can use to see what it does and if it fits your purpose.

#### 5\. iSpoofer

![ispoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-6.jpg)

Probably one of the most known apps at one point in time, iSpoofer was great at spoofing location on iPhone until Niantic, the makers of Pokémon GO, detected the app, and banned it. The app still works with some tricks up its sleeve, but we do not really recommend it, given that it was detected once and if you are detected using the app, you will be banned from the Poke-verse for good.

Now for the top location spoofer apps on Android OS! Some from above are also compatible with and fully support Android going up to version 14, so you might see duplicates.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location can be used to effectively spoof GPS coordinates on Android devices as well. An issue that other spoofing apps present is that the location might jump between its true location and falsified location, which means that other apps might present a location spoofing solution that is not stable. That is not the case with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android) where a location once set remains set as long as you want it to, and will not jump.

At this point, instructions change depending on the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device you connected. There are different instructions for iPhone and Android. Please visit [this](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/connect-android-ios-device-to-fake-location.html) link to connect your specific device.

Step 4: After you have connected your respective device, now comes the fun part – spoofing your location! If you want to simply prank your friends or use dating apps and other apps where you simply want a different location, you can use the Jump Teleport mode to simply change your location to anywhere in the world. However, in location-based games, you need to be seen walking or moving around in the environment. In that case, use the One-stop Route mode.

Here’s how to simulate movement using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to play location-based games.

Click the third option from the top right to enter One-stop Route mode. Enter a location to teleport to and click Move Here (1).

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.
