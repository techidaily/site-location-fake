Many games are of their interest, but Mobile Legends has always been on the top of the list. Mobile Legends is a game that can be played by a few people simultaneously, and it is called MOBA.

## **Part 1: Why Do We Need to Fake Location on ML**

Some players want to fake-locate Mobile Legends because it is highly competitive and it usually ranks globally or locally. Most players prefer local street rankings, which are specified according to the area. The GPS detects the location of the Honor 70 Lite 5G devices in your area while you are in the game. Spoofing your location can bring you new requests and challenges that were practically unavailable in your area.

You can also earn a supreme title by using a fake GPS for ML**.** Here’s a list of countries that have a low MMR or power and are considered the best location for fake GPS ML:

- Kuwait
- Mexico
- Romania
- Ukraine
- Qatar
- Peru
- Egypt
- Russia
- Belarus
