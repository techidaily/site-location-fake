As you are well aware of the dangers of the internet, it doesn't make sense to turn your Chrome into a beacon for ill-intentioned people.

![google chrome featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-1.jpg)

## Part 1: How Does Chrome Know Your Location?

Before discussing Google **Chrome's fake location**, it is important to know how Chrome detects your physical location. Google Chrome uses many ways to pinpoint your exact location, like your IP address, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Cell Tower data. Every internet connection has an IP address bound to a location that enables Chrome to identify your location.

Similarly, GPS location can easily be tracked if your phone device has it enabled. All the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections around you also have location information embedded in them. They can help Chrome track you as long as your device can detect them. If you use cell data, Google Chrome can also track you through cell towers.

## Part 2: How to Hide Location Services in Chrome?

If you are worried about Google Chrome detecting your physical location and sharing it with websites and apps, you can hide it easily. The process of hiding your location on Google Chrome is simple, even if you are using multiple devices. Below is the step-by-step process of hiding location services in Google Chrome on computer, Android, and iOS devices.

### Method 1: For Laptop and Desktop PCs

**Step 1:** Launch Google Chrome on your computer and click the "Three Dots" icon to open the Google Chrome Settings. Here, tap "Privacy and Security" from the left sidebar and select "Site Settings."

![access the site settings option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Navigate to "Permissions" and click on "Location." To hide the location on Google Chrome, select the "Don't allow sites to see your location" option.

![enable the dont allow option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-3.jpg)

### Method 2: For iPhone or iPad

**Step 1:** Navigate to "Settings" on your iPhone and open it. Scroll down until you find the "Chrome" app option and select it.

![proceed with the chrome option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Press "Location" on the next screen to open the location options for Google Chrome. Here, choose "Never" to stop Google Chrome from detecting your location.

![choose the never option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-5.jpg)

![disable the location option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-7.jpg)

One way to protect your privacy and stop websites from tracking your location is to turn off the location, but it has many disadvantages. If you have turned off your location, you can't use any location base service like food delivery, e-shopping, ride-sharing, etc. That's why it is better to use a fake location on your browser. Below we have explained four methods for **Chrome fake location**.

### Method 1. Best Tool to Fake Chrome Location On iOS and Android Phones

### Method 2. Manually Change Your Location Using Google Chrome DevTools

It is also possible to **fake browser location** on Chrome using the Google Chrome Developer Tools. It is a built-in feature of Chrome and can be used to manually change or turn off your browser's location. Follow these steps for changing location on Chrome with DevTools:

**Step 1:** After opening Google Chrome, click the three-dots icon from the top right corner. It will open the Chrome menu where you need to select "Developer Tools" after clicking "More Tools."

![choose the developer tools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-11.jpg)

**Limitations**

- The interface of the Google Chrome DevTools can be very confusing and overwhelming for non-technical users.
- Apart from pre-added locations, it can be hard to add a specific location as your fake location.

### Method 3. Fake Your Location Using Chrome Extension

Many **fake location Chrome extensions** are available on Google Chrome which can be used to alter your location on Chrome. You can find these extensions on Google Chrome Web Store and add them directly to your browser. Below we have explained the steps for using such an extension "[Location Guard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/location-guard/cfohepagpmnodfdmjliccbbigdkfcgia?hl=en)" to fake your location on Google Chrome:

**Step 1:** Open the "Location Guard" on Chrome Web Store and click "Add to Chrome" to add it to your browser. Once the "Location Guard" extension is added, open it and press "Options."

![install the location guard extension](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-14.jpg)

**Step 2:** In the options, you can choose different options like Privacy Levels, Protection Area, and Time for Location Cache. It is recommended you choose a higher level for more protection.

![customize the settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-15.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can also use the "Fixed Location" feature to set up a fake location as a permanent location for your browser. The fixed location can be added by using the market or clicking on the desired place on the map.

![confirm the fixed location position](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-16.jpg)

**Limitations**

- Location Guard doesn't protect your IP address. It means some websites can still detect your real location using the IP address.
- The app is not updated for quite a while, that's why the map of the fixed location feature is quite restricted.

### Method 4. Spoof Your IP Using a VPN Server

Another way you can fool websites and your browser by displaying a **fake location online** is to use a VPN server. VPNs fake your IP address to fool websites and apps into detecting your location. [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) is a VPN that can be used to spoof your IP by following these steps:

**Step 1:** Download and install NordVPN on your computer or phone and log in using your account. If you don't have a NordVPN account, you must create one first.

**Step 2:** If you want to just change the location of your device, you can select "Quick Connect." Using it will enable the program to automatically find the most suited fake location for you.

![tap on the quick connect button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-17.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can also choose the desired location as your fake Chrome location in NordVPN. To do that, scroll down the list of countries and locations and choose your desired locations to connect to.

**Limitations**

- NordVPN can only spoof your IP address and will not work for geo-restricted applications.
- Using a VPN usually affects your internet speed and can make browsing slower and more difficult.

![find my friends location not available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device, while "Location Not Available" means that the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

![enable location services](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg)

### Tip 3: Adjust ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

![adjust date and time](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg)

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

![check internet connection](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg)

### Tip 5: Enable Share My Location

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

![enable share my location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg)

Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.

For Android users, go to "Settings" > "Additional settings" > "Privacy" > "Location", and choose the location mode to enable it.

### Tip 6: Restart the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

![restart ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra ](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra .jpg)

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.

### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you've faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.
