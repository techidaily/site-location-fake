Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content.

But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Itel P55+ location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Itel P55+ is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Itel P55+ device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Itel-P55-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Itel-P55-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Itel P55+ using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Itel P55+ using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Itel P55+ by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Itel P55+ by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Itel P55+ stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Itel P55+ device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Itel P55+ unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Itel P55+ as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Itel-P55-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Itel-P55-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Itel P55+ using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Itel P55+ using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the ZTE Blade A73 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location ZTE Blade A73 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the ZTE Blade A73 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your ZTE Blade A73 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your ZTE Blade A73 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part.

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy. Using the “Privacy Levels” option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg"                      alt="set the privacy levels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using its “Fixed Location” feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location.

It requires players to move around one place to the other in reality to capture Pokémon. But if you don’t want to go out of his way and search for Pokémon then iPogo is a tool for you. It is a location spoofer that can change the location of your device. It allows you to move from one place to another with just one-tap. As it is a cheat tool, you might want to know can iPogo get you banned?

But it does that by breaking many rules and regulations created by Niantic. Here are some features of iPogo for Pokemon Go that are not by the books:</p><ul><li><strong>Play from anywhere, anytime:</strong></li></ul><p>iPogo allows users to play Pokemon go anytime from anywhere in the world. All you will require is a decent internet connection, and you are good to go. And this is something that Niantic strongly opposes.</p><ul><li><strong>Spoofing:</strong></li></ul><p>Niantic has arranged several ban waves once a week for players who were found cheating. The humorous thing to note here is that most of such players were caught spoofing. And this app lets you do exactly that. This also had a stimulating effect on the iPogo ban rates.</p><ul><li><strong>It works like a Go-Plus</strong></li></ul><p>This app works like a virtual go-plus, enabling your device to change its location via switching servers. But that doesn’t assure any safety from the likes of Niantic.</p><ul><li><strong>Third-party software</strong></li></ul><p>This app also works as a third-party software as it runs in the background while you are playing the game. Sometimes Niantic can detect that as well, and you might have to face an iPogo ban.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What’s-the-rate-of-iPogo-ban"><a href="#Part-2-What’s-the-rate-of-iPogo-ban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What’s the rate of iPogo ban"></a>Part 2: What’s the rate of iPogo ban</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-ban-intro-2.jpg"                      alt="ipogo ban intro 2"                ></p><p>Players mostly use iPogo for location spoofing, which is very common in Pokémon go.

In Pokémon Go players, are banned on a 3-Strike basis.</p><p>If you are using iPogo as a location spoofer, kindly note that it is perilous to do that. If you receive the 1st strike as an iPogo ban, I strongly suggest you never use iPogo again because Niantic will keep a close watch on you. So if your question is, can iPogo get me banned?

It is an excellent choice for staying updated about family when you have security concerns. Despite this, it can be intrusive when you need your privacy. If you’re a group member and wonder how to turn off Life360 without parents knowing on iPhone and Android devices, you’re in luck. This article will provide you with a complete guide on how to turn off Life 360 without anyone knowing.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Life-360"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Life-360" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Life 360?"></a>Part 1: What is Life 360?</h2><p>Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch. This tracking app makes it easy to trace the location of your loved ones or anyone you want to track. But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png"                      alt="life360 for location sharing"                ></p><p>Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png"                      alt="life360 map showing circles"                ></p><p>Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency. In addition, the app automatically contacts the emergency contacts you added when you do this. However, this doesn’t change that it can get intrusive when you need some privacy. That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.png"                      alt="sending help alert on life360"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing</h2><p>There are times when you want to turn Life360 off without it showing so that people don’t know your present location. But, if you have no idea how to go about it, you’re in luck. This section covers the best methods to stop sharing your location with friends and family on Life360.</p><h3 id="1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360"><a href="#1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360"></a>1. <strong>Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360</strong></h3><p>There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.</p><ul><li>First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.</li><li>Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png"                      alt="locate the circle on life360"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on ‘location sharing’ and click on the slider next to it to disable location sharing.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.jpg"                      alt="click on location sharing"                ></p><ul><li>Now you can recheck the map, and it will show ‘location sharing paused.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-Your-Asus-ROG-Phone-8’s-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-off-Your-Asus-ROG-Phone-8’s-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn off Your Asus ROG Phone 8’s Airplane Mode"></a>2. <strong>Turn off Your Asus ROG Phone 8’s Airplane Mode</strong></h3><p>Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.</p><p><strong>For your iOS devices</strong>: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong> owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Disable GPS Service on Your Device"></a>3. <strong>Disable GPS Service on Your Device</strong></h3><p>Another top method of turning off Life360 is disabling the GPS service on your device. It is an effective option, and you can carry it out on your iOS and Android devices. Below, we’ll break down the steps of doing this on your Android and iOS devices.</p><p><strong>For iOS</strong></p><p>iOS users can easily turn off GPS services by following the steps we’ll be providing below.</p><ul><li>First, open Settings on your smartphone.</li><li>Next, locate the ‘personal’ category and tap on ‘location services’ from the options displayed.</li><li>Next, disable GPS location services</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-8.png"                      alt="disable gps location services on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong></p><p>You’re not left out of this option; below are the steps to disable GPS service on your Asus ROG Phone 8s.</p><ul><li>Firstly, visit ‘settings’ on your device.</li><li>On the menu, scroll to ‘privacy’ and tap on it.</li><li>It will open a new page.

If you want some privacy or don’t trust members of your circle, you might want to learn how to turn off Life 360. The problem with turning off the Life360 location is that members of your circle might notice, which would inevitably cause some conflict.</p><p>Fortunately, you have another effective option, and that is by faking your GPS location using a location spoofer. You can display the location you want while keeping your true location safe on Life360. Dr. Fone –Virtual location is an excellent tool for faking your location.  </p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><strong>Steps to Fake Location Using Dr. Fone – Virtual Location</strong></p><p>Below, we’ve broken down the process for you; keep reading to learn how to fake location using Dr. Fone – Virtual Location.</p><p>1.

This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Asus ROG Phone 8 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Asus ROG Phone 8 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Asus ROG Phone 8 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Asus ROG Phone 8 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Asus ROG Phone 8 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Asus ROG Phone 8 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Asus-ROG-Phone-8-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Asus-ROG-Phone-8-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Asus ROG Phone 8 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Asus ROG Phone 8 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Of course, you can also run the software in the background, which may be accomplished in a variety of straightforward but distinct ways based on the Tecno Phantom V Fold device’s model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_2.jpg"                      alt="double-check your current location"                ></p><p>You may access the Background App Refresh function by going to the settings menu on your iOS device and selecting “Settings,” followed by “General,” and then selecting “Background App Refresh.” Next, launch the location services function by navigating to “Settings”&gt; “Privacy”&gt; “location services” and selecting “Location Services” from the drop-down menu.</p><p>After that, touch on the symbol that represents Life360, as shown below; this will take you to a screen where you may change “Allow Location Access” to “Always” and “Enable Precise Location.”</p><h3 id="Method-3-Connecting-One-Device-at-a-Time"><a href="#Method-3-Connecting-One-Device-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time"></a>Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time</h3><p>Only one device may be used to sign in to the Life 360 app at a time. To prevent the life360 false location problem, log out of all other devices and use just one. When many devices are logged into Life 360 simultaneously, the user’s location might be incorrectly determined.</p><p>If you want reliable results, you must be logged in from the same device. If you use numerous devices simultaneously to log in to Life360, it will report incorrect location errors for each one. Therefore, it is possible to get inaccurate data. Use a single device to log into life360 to prevent the issue of a wrong location showing up.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Keep-Your-Location-on-Life360-in-One-Place"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Keep-Your-Location-on-Life360-in-One-Place" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?"></a>Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?</h2><p>Two of the most important and easy ways to keep your location on life360 in one place are:</p><h3 id="1-Stopping-both-Wi-Fi-and-Cellular-Data-Transmissions"><a href="#1-Stopping-both-Wi-Fi-and-Cellular-Data-Transmissions" class="headerlink" title="1.

The process of faking the location involves the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Access Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and Move to Toolbox</strong></p><p>Begin with the launch of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location on your computer and establish a connection with your Android or iOS device. Navigate to the map screen and select the “Teleport Mode” icon, which is situated as the first option in the toolbar near the top-right corner. Now, start the process by tapping the search bar at the top left corner, inputting your desired location, and hitting “Enter.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="select the desired location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Move to the Targeted Location and Verify It</strong></p><p>Upon completion of the initial setup, proceed to teleport to the targeted location by clicking “Move Here” on the map screen. This action prompts the cursor to relocate to the specified location on the map. It also simultaneously adjusts the location of your Android or iOS device. To validate the successful location change, access your smartphone and open a map application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="click the move here button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem"><a href="#Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?"></a>Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?</h2><p>Faking your GPS has its advantages, primarily protecting your privacy.</p><p>However, if you’re on the receiving end of a fake GPS signal, you need to detect any spoofing attempts before it’s too late. You need to have a security measure to ensure data you’re receiving is coming from a legitimate source instead of a malicious one. It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.</p><p>Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.</p><p><strong>Food Delivery</strong></p><p>Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to. They may also gain an unfair advantage to gain priority in order queues and report longer rides to earn more from the platform.

This is what geo-blocking means. If you want to know more about geo-blocking, you have come to the right article. This article provides the definition, symbols, function, type, and how to bypass a geo-blocked site.</p><p>Encryption is often used in geo-blocking as a means of protecting material that is restricted to users in just certain locations. In its long existence, the method has been met with several obstacles. These obstacles will be discussed in the next sections!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/what-is-geo-blocking-and-how-to-bypass-it-academy.jpg"                      alt="what is geo blocking"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

It will also show how websites inform viewers that they are in geo-blocking areas.</p><h3 id="Definition-of-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Definition-of-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Definition of Geo-Blocking"></a>Definition of Geo-Blocking</h3><p>Geo-blocking is the practice of restricting online access to certain users depending on where in the world they happen to be physically located. Telecommunications firms, websites, and other content providers and intellectual property owners often use this method for copyright protection. To monitor and enforce geo-blocks, databases that map out IP addresses’ geographical locations are often employed.</p><h3 id="Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements"><a href="#Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements"></a>Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements</h3><p>You sometimes can’t access a site because it isn’t available in your area. This is the main element carried by geo-blocking.</p><p>Every online-surfing tool has a unique identifier called “IP address”. The address can identify the Itel A70 devices’ geographical location. When users access a website, their devices send their IP addresses to the online servers. The servers read if the IP addresses are included in the allowed list and determine whether to allow the visitors to view the content.</p><p>The visitors usually know they are geographically limited through the website’s displayed outcomes, a poster indicating that the service is unavailable in the location. Take the geo-banned access by Airbnb as an example below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/service-unavailable-in-location.jpg"                      alt="geo blocked airbnb"                ></p><p>Although Airbnb has been criticized for posing a threat to the availability of low-cost lodging in metropolitan areas, it has proven to be a useful resource for travelers. However, not everyone can use it; for instance, it is unavailable in Iran due to US sanctions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Geo-Blocking-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Geo-Blocking-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?</h2><p>When a firm, rather than a government, is responsible for geoblocking, IP addresses are often the first line of defense. Your IP address is like a street address, revealing where you live.</p><p>IP addresses are numerical identifiers that distinguish each machine on the internet. Your computer’s IP address is sent to the server of the website you visit so that it may supply the required data.</p><p>You’ll be assigned an IP address when you sign up for an Internet Service Provider. It is possible to pinpoint the location of your device using its IP address, albeit the degree of precision may vary. Websites use the IP address to determine whether you can read their content. They will thus refuse your request if you are using an IP address that’s not on their approved list.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Some home routers can generate VPN connections, but not all.</p><p>By changing your DNS address, clever DNS may alter your device’s virtual location. Smart DNS replaces your Internet provider’s DNS server. Netflix.com’s IP is not netflix.com. You’ll acquire the smart DNS provider’s transparent DNS proxy IP.

A proxy server does what its name implies: it acts on your behalf to get access to the data and then forwards it to you. Proxy servers, especially those in foreign countries, may be used to get around geographical restrictions.</p><p>Depending on the kind of proxy server you use, you may or may not be able to conceal your IP address when surfing the web. Proxy servers are available online and may be accessed from any web browser.

The Tor browser links to the Tor network, a collection of computers that collaborate to conceal your online footprint by relaying your traffic via several intermediary nodes.</p><p>Tor employs a technique called “onion routing” to conceal its users’ identities. Since more time is required to traverse these additional levels, your internet speed may suffer as a consequence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/use-tor-browser-to-bypass-geo-blocking.jpg"                      alt="tor for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection"><a href="#Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. A Good VPN Connection"></a>Method 4. A Good VPN Connection</h3><p>A virtual private network (VPN) may hide your online identity and protect your data by encrypting your connection. VPNs allow you to get around geographically restricted material by redirecting your connection via a server in another country. This will allow you to connect to VPN servers in other countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, or Australia.</p><p>With <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/pokemon-go/spoof-pokemon-go-location-with-vpn.html" >effective VPN tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can surf the web anonymously, unblock geo-blocked content, and watch your favorite programs abroad. There are several advantages to utilizing a VPN, particularly when you travel or use public Wi-Fi, and they are simple to set up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/vpn-working-principle.jpg"                      alt="vpn for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQs-About-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Part-5-FAQs-About-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. FAQs About Geo-Blocking"></a>Part 5. FAQs About Geo-Blocking</h2><p>Here are the answers to four questions that you might ask about geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="1-Is-Geo-Blocking-Legal"><a href="#1-Is-Geo-Blocking-Legal" class="headerlink" title="1. Is Geo-Blocking Legal?"></a>1. Is Geo-Blocking Legal?</h3><p>Yes. It’s legitimate. Limiting access to websites and services based on a user’s location is lawful. This practice is routinely used in nations like China to prevent citizens from seeing politically sensitive material. Legal arrangements, such as licensing agreements, may also be enforced by geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal"><a href="#2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal" class="headerlink" title="2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?"></a>2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?</h3><p>It depends. Depending on the situation, the nation, the purpose of the use, and the technique used, geo-blocking circumvention may be against the law. Copyright regulations prohibit users from accessing material beyond its designated location, yet many providers are reluctant to penalize users for doing so.</p><h3 id="3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?"></a>3. What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>Geo-fencing is to create digital fences on which to base real-world judgments about where to go. One may draw a boundary around it using longitude and latitude lines on a map to easily establish who is permitted inside a certain region. Restricting access to material based on a user’s physical location is called “geo-blocking.”</p><h3 id="4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?"></a>4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>They are the same. Restricting a user’s ability to access certain online resources depending on their location is known as geo-blocking or geo-restriction. To safeguard their license agreements, foreign media streaming firms often use the practice of geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>For several reasons, media and content producers use geo-blocking. Although geo-blocking is unlikely to ever go out of style, there are techniques to circumvent it. Use a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass geo-restrictions on the material you want to watch. Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), a proxy server, the Tor network, etc., your online location may be hidden or masked.</p><p>Geo-blocking controls. It’s both useful and abused. Website banning discriminates and manipulates. Geography may be annoying and frustrating. Sadly, they may always be in style. You don’t have to tolerate them!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-fake-gps-without-root-on-apple-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>3 Ways to Fake GPS Without Root On Apple iPhone 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/a-detailed-vpna-fake-gps-location-free-review-on-realme-11-proplus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Realme 11 Pro+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-vivo-v29-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Vivo V29 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/all-must-knows-to-use-fake-gps-go-location-spoofer-on-apple-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>All Must-Knows to Use Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer On Apple iPhone 7 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/6-ways-to-change-spotify-location-on-your-realme-11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Realme 11 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-vivo-y78t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Vivo Y78t | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-poco-m6-5g-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Poco M6 5G?

Since there are so many location spoofing tools out there, I decided to give VPNa Fake GPS location app a try and have come up with its genuine review here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More"><a href="#Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More"></a>Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More</h2><p>Developed by XdoApp, VPNa Fake GPS is a popular application that can change the location of your Android virtually. Using it, you can spoof your device location to almost anywhere in the world. This would be reflected in almost all the installed gaming, dating, and other apps on your phone automatically.</p><ul><li>You can look for any location on the interface of VPNa Fake GPS by entering keywords (name&#x2F;address) or the exact coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the place.</li><li>To fake GPS using VPNa, you would be presented with a map-like interface and can easily move the pin around to spoof your location to an exact place.</li><li>Besides that, if there is a location that you change frequently, then you can also mark it as a favorite.</li><li>The VPNa fake GPS location APK would also maintain the record of the past locations that you have spoofed.</li><li>Using VPNa Fake GPS, you can change your location as many times as you want without paying anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/vpna/vpna-fake-gps-1.jpg"                      alt="use vpns fake gps"                ></p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><ul><li>The changed location would be reflected in almost every dating and gaming app.</li><li>The basic version of VPNa Fake GPS is available for free and doesn’t need root access.</li><li>The overall interface of VPNa Fake GPS APK is pretty user-friendly and smooth.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Cons</em></strong></p><ul><li>At times, some advanced apps (like Pokemon Go) can detect it and might get your account banned.</li><li>While using the free VPNa fake GPS version, you would get in-app ads.</li><li>Sometimes, the location is not spoofed even after consecutive attempts.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Pricing</em></strong>: While you can access the basic version of VPNa Fake GPS for free, you can pay $2.99 for an ad-free experience.</p><p><strong><em>Compatibility</em></strong>: Android 4.4 and newer versions</p><p><strong><em>Play Store Rating:</em></strong> 3.6&#x2F;5</p><p><strong><em>Important Note</em></strong></p><p>Don’t get confused by the name of VPNa Fake GPS as it is not a VPN, but only a location spoofing solution.

Solving the internet issues"></a>1. Solving the internet issues</h3><p>Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.</p><p>If this is the cause of your <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong>, there isn’t much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to “Mapbox” to see if it addresses the problem.</p><h3 id="2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software"><a href="#2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="2. Restarting and Closing the Software"></a>2. Restarting and Closing the Software</h3><p>When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg"                      alt="restart the software"                ></p><h3 id="3-3uTools-reinstallation"><a href="#3-3uTools-reinstallation" class="headerlink" title="3. 3uTools reinstallation"></a>3. 3uTools reinstallation</h3><p>The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg"                      alt="reinstall 3utools"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restarting-Your-Computer"><a href="#4-Restarting-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="4.

If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg"                      alt="restart computer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked"><a href="#5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked" class="headerlink" title="5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked"></a>5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked</h3><p>When you encounter a ‘not working’ problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg"                      alt="verify the netwrok connection"                ></p><h3 id="6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded"><a href="#6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded" class="headerlink" title="6.

Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded</h3><p>Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.</p><h3 id="7-Changing-the-Source-Map"><a href="#7-Changing-the-Source-Map" class="headerlink" title="7.

Then, try restarting it. Install iTunes from the App Store once more. Restart your computer.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="6-Ways-to-Change-Spotify-Location-On-Your-Realme-12-Pro-5G"><a href="#6-Ways-to-Change-Spotify-Location-On-Your-Realme-12-Pro-5G" class="headerlink" title="6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G"></a>6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png"                      alt="change location"                ></p><p>Spotify’s booming audio business is proof that people are in love with its services. If you want to listen to your favorite retro song, or you want to discover the latest hits, Spotify has everything. You can also listen to some really good podcasts and album hits. But what most of us don’t know is that your Spotify Location can determine what kind of content you might come across on the platform.</p><p>Your playlist suggestions depend on the country and region you are staying in. And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify</strong></h2><p>Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.</p><p><strong>Region Specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg"                      alt="region specific spotify content"                ></p><p>The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.</p><p><strong>Geo-Based Suggestions</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg"                      alt="sopify playlist"                ></p><p>Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.</p><p><strong>But is Spotify available everywhere?</strong></p><p>How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.</p><p>The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone"></a><strong>Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone</strong></h2><p>Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content. To make that possible, you can use some of the best online tools to fake spotify location whenever you want. Instead of going for the regular Spotify Update Location, you can use these third-party applications to change the location on your iPhone devices (will reflect in Spotify too).</p><p>The Wondershare’s Dr. Fone is a very good application that lets you change location Spotify with a few easy steps. It hardly takes a few minutes and this is how you go about it-</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you will find the download versions for Mac, and Windows.

Not only on Spotify, your other social media apps and location using apps will also record the new virtual location.</p><p><strong>Cydia - Location Faker App</strong></p><p>For the Spotify Change Region, Cydia’s Location Faker App is the perfect choice for iPhones. The software is also available in different versions to choose for your device model. You won’t need a computer for this and everything happens over your iPhone only.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Locationfaker version suitable for your phone. Locationfaker8 is available for the 8.0 version of iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-locationfaker-version-app-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download locationfaker"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will notice a map appear on the screen. You can either move your pin-point to the new location or enter the address or coordinates into the search box on top of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/toggle-off-and-on-pic10.jpg"                      alt="map toggle off and on"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you settle with the coordinates, shift the ‘Off’ toggle to ‘On’. It is present at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-and-permit-apps-pic11.jpg"                      alt="change off toggle to on"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On the bottom of the page, in the same line as the toggle, you will find the ‘i’ icon. Click on that and several options will open. From there, choose ‘White List’. All the apps that need access to your new location will display.

Fix Now"></a>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro? Fix Now</h2><p>The map frequently breaks or 3uTools is unable to retrieve it.

You can set a virtual location on your iPhone, iPad, or any other iDevice using the VirtualLocation option in the program. In addition, you can broadcast the location on social media and get around service and game area restrictions.</p><p>To set up 3uTools, there are only a few steps to take.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Set up 3uTools on your computer first.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Connect your iPhone to the PC on which you installed 3uTools in Step 2.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Launch 3uTools and choose the Toolbox option from the top menu in step 3.</li><li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Select the VirtualLocation icon from the toolbox.</li><li><strong>Step 5</strong>: A new window will open.

Solving the internet issues"></a>1. Solving the internet issues</h3><p>Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.</p><p>If this is the cause of your <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong>, there isn’t much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to “Mapbox” to see if it addresses the problem.</p><h3 id="2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software"><a href="#2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="2. Restarting and Closing the Software"></a>2. Restarting and Closing the Software</h3><p>When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg"                      alt="restart the software"                ></p><h3 id="3-3uTools-reinstallation"><a href="#3-3uTools-reinstallation" class="headerlink" title="3. 3uTools reinstallation"></a>3. 3uTools reinstallation</h3><p>The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg"                      alt="reinstall 3utools"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restarting-Your-Computer"><a href="#4-Restarting-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="4. Restarting Your Computer"></a>4. Restarting Your Computer</h3><p>Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg"                      alt="restart computer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked"><a href="#5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked" class="headerlink" title="5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked"></a>5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked</h3><p>When you encounter a ‘not working’ problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg"                      alt="verify the netwrok connection"                ></p><h3 id="6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded"><a href="#6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded" class="headerlink" title="6. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded"></a>6. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded</h3><p>Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.</p><h3 id="7-Changing-the-Source-Map"><a href="#7-Changing-the-Source-Map" class="headerlink" title="7. Changing the Source Map"></a>7. Changing the Source Map</h3><p>Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt “Load embedded maps” to solve this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-6.jpg"                      alt="load embedded maps"                ></p><p>Alternatively, change the source map between Google Maps and Open Street Maps.</p><h3 id="8-Uninstalling-iTunes-and-rebooting-your-system"><a href="#8-Uninstalling-iTunes-and-rebooting-your-system" class="headerlink" title="8. Uninstalling iTunes and rebooting your system"></a>8. Uninstalling iTunes and rebooting your system</h3><p>Many customers have reported encountering the “3uTools virtual location developer image load failed” problem, with the majority of them appearing to be iOS 17 users. 3uTools either does not load the location images or the screen becomes frozen.</p><p>Remove iTunes from your computer. Then, try restarting it. Install iTunes from the App Store once more. Restart your computer. After that, connect your iPhone to a PC and confirm that it is unlocked.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-3uTools-Virtual-Location-Alternative-Program-You-Can-Use-in-2024"><a href="#Part-3-Best-3uTools-Virtual-Location-Alternative-Program-You-Can-Use-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best 3uTools Virtual Location Alternative Program You Can Use in 2024"></a>Part 3: Best 3uTools Virtual Location Alternative Program You Can Use in 2024</h2><p>Stop fretting if you frequently encounter the <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong> problem despite attempting various fixes.

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Spoofer.

Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal.

Why Netflix Offers Different Shows in Every Country</h2><p>Netflix is definitely one of the largest video streaming services of our time. It’s currently available in over 190 countries globally. The majority of its content is widely accessible regardless of location. You can binge-watch on them anytime and anywhere so long as their individual broadcast license remains active. But as mentioned earlier, there are some Netflix shows that are not available worldwide.</p><p>There are many potential reasons why Netflix shows vary from one region to another. One of them is cultural influence. Of course, Netflix prioritizes the screening of shows that are highly relatable for the target audience. Hence, the content available in certain locations is locally sourced or regionally concentrated. But that’s not all. There are other reasons why Netflix offers different shows in every country. Check out the list below to understand it better.</p><h3 id="The-theme-of-the-Netflix-show-contradicts-certain-government-rules-or-traditional-beliefs"><a href="#The-theme-of-the-Netflix-show-contradicts-certain-government-rules-or-traditional-beliefs" class="headerlink" title="The theme of the Netflix show contradicts certain government rules or traditional beliefs"></a>The theme of the Netflix show contradicts certain government rules or traditional beliefs</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-1.JPG"                      alt="banned netflix shows"                ></p><p>Netflix holds traditional beliefs in high regard and abides by government rules. If the show depicts sensitive topics that certain countries don’t openly discuss, its viewing is immediately restricted in the region. That’s probably the reason why a particular Netflix show is unavailable in your region. Is there a way to access it without traveling anywhere? Luckily, there is. Find a tutorial online on how to change your location on Netflix. Follow the steps accordingly until your Netflix location is modified. After that, the restricted show must be available now on your end.</p><h3 id="There-are-some-issues-regarding-copyright-ownership"><a href="#There-are-some-issues-regarding-copyright-ownership" class="headerlink" title="There are some issues regarding copyright ownership"></a>There are some issues regarding copyright ownership</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-2.JPG"                      alt="netflix shows copyright"                ></p><p>In simple terms, copyright ownership is enforced separately in each country. That means Netflix must secure individual licenses for every region. Sometimes, certain countries fail to acquire copyright ownership due to the cost and other factors. As a result, the content becomes unavailable in that particular location. We cannot do anything about it unless you’re willing to shell out money for the license. But if you’re really eager to get hold of the restricted Netflix show, try to modify your device’s primary location. Don’t worry. There are many tutorials online on how to change your Netflix location. Just choose one and follow the instructions indicated.</p><h3 id="The-Netflix-show-has-varying-release-dates-for-each-region"><a href="#The-Netflix-show-has-varying-release-dates-for-each-region" class="headerlink" title="The Netflix show has varying release dates for each region"></a>The Netflix show has varying release dates for each region</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-3.JPG"                      alt="netflix show release date"                ></p><p>Maybe there is no complicated issue behind the geo-blocking of a particular Netflix show in your region. It’s possible that the release date is actually different in every country. If that’s the case, there is nothing to worry about. It’s just another marketing tactic to add an element of surprise for the fans. All you have to do now is sit back and wait as patiently as you can. If you’re too excited to be counting down the days, you may try to alter the location settings on your device.

Thus, your location settings show modified coordinates whenever you browse the internet with a VPN enabled. That also works with streaming Netflix shows that are currently restricted in your region. Do you want to try it? Here’s a short guide on how to change your location on Netflix using Virtual Private Networks.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First and foremost, check the current standing of your Netflix account and make sure it is active. Once confirmed, choose your preferred VPN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-4.jpg"                      alt="active netflix account"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Then, download and install your selected Virtual Private Network. Register an account afterward and subscribe to a paid plan if necessary.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Activate the VPN on your device. From there, choose a country where you wish to direct your internet traffic.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-5.jpg"                      alt="connect to vpn"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once successfully activated, you can now access Netflix on your device and search for the restricted TV show you want to watch.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-Stream-Netflix-shows-with-a-web-proxy-server"><a href="#Method-2-Stream-Netflix-shows-with-a-web-proxy-server" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Stream Netflix shows with a web proxy server"></a>Method 2: Stream Netflix shows with a web proxy server</h3><p>For the most part, a web proxy server basically works like a Virtual Private Network. It reroutes your internet traffic to a particular server from a different location. Through this tactic, Netflix fails to detect that you’re using its service from a restricted region. A web proxy server is often free of charge. Thus, it’s a great alternative to VPNs if you don’t want to spend money just to access unavailable content on your device. Do you want to try it now? Here’s how to change your Netflix location using a web proxy server.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose your preferred web proxy server and then visit its official website. Create an account if necessary.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, select a server from the available options. Make sure that the server you’re going to choose is not geologically blocklisted on Netflix.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-6.jpg"                      alt="select a server"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the official web address of Netflix into the URL bar and then proceed immediately.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait while the web proxy server is loading up your request. After a few minutes, the Netflix dashboard must be displayed on your computer screen. From there, you can now browse its catalog and binge-watch the content currently restricted in your region. That’s exactly how to change your location on Netflix with a web proxy server.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-7.jpg"                      alt="stream netflix"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stream-Netflix-shows-from-the-Tor-browser"><a href="#Method-3-Stream-Netflix-shows-from-the-Tor-browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stream Netflix shows from the Tor browser"></a>Method 3: Stream Netflix shows from the Tor browser</h3><p>Tor browser is primarily used for ultra-private internet browsing. Your online activities on this platform are encrypted and directed to about three various servers located worldwide. Although you cannot actually change your location settings, your actual IP address will be masked and routed somewhere else. This way, you get a higher chance of accessing restricted Netflix shows from the comfort of your own home. Do you want to try it now? Here’s the guide on how to change your Netflix region using the Tor browser.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download Tor browser from its <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/"><u>official website.</u></a> After that, install it on your computer.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Launch the Tor browser on your desktop and hit <strong>Connect.</strong> Make sure that Tor has been successfully configured on your device.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try-On-Vivo-X90S"><a href="#5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try-On-Vivo-X90S" class="headerlink" title="5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Vivo X90S"></a>5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Vivo X90S</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png"                      alt="change location"                ></p><p>Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg"                      alt="Route Generator App Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?"></a>Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?</h2><p>In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.</p><p>Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try</h2><p>If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:</p><ol><li><strong>Route4Me</strong></li></ol><p>Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices.

The good news is that MLB has started on Thursday, April 7. Moreover, the final MLB match will be played on Sunday, October 2. Therefore, there will be around 162 games in the MLB season which is very exciting for the fans worldwide. Additionally, 30 MLB teams are playing this season.</p><p>However, unfortunately, there will be <strong>MLB TV blackout</strong>s during the games. It is frustrating for the fans that adore baseball a lot. Does it mean we should stay here and do nothing? Of course not. We are here to give you the solution to bypass <strong>MLB blackouts.</strong> In this article, we are about to recognize the following topics:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Bypass-MLB-Blackouts-Restrictions-from-Anywhere"><a href="#Part-1-Bypass-MLB-Blackouts-Restrictions-from-Anywhere" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Bypass MLB Blackouts Restrictions from Anywhere"></a>Part 1: Bypass MLB Blackouts Restrictions from Anywhere</h2><p>The reason for <strong>the MLB blackout</strong> is not a complicated one. First, the cable providers want to broadcast MLB on their local networks exclusively, and the other reason for the blackout is MLB’s desire to have a maximum number of fans in the stadium to attend the match. However, not all fans want to come out of their homes to watch a match.</p><h3 id="Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-to-Bypass-MLB-Blackouts-on-Vivo-X90S"><a href="#Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-to-Bypass-MLB-Blackouts-on-Vivo-X90S" class="headerlink" title="Use Dr.Fone Virtual Location to Bypass MLB Blackouts on Vivo X90S"></a>Use Dr.Fone Virtual Location to Bypass MLB Blackouts on Vivo X90S</h3><p>Luckily, Dr.Fone provides a virtual location feature that encourages users to teleport the GPS location to anywhere they want with a single click.

If you cannot find it, tap on the “Center On” icon on the right side of the screen. Now, enable the “Teleport Mode” through the first icon on the upper right side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="enable teleport mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Set your Location</strong></p><p>Enter the place you want to convert to, and press the “Go” button.

You can always find the joystick on the lower left part in teleport mode. And you can also click the joystick button in the upper right (the 5th one) to use the joystick feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png"                      alt="try joystick movement for simulation"                ></p><p>The joystick, like one-stop route or multi-stop route modes, aims to facilitate GPS movement on the map. But what’s better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic GPS movement:</strong> Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.</li><li><strong>Manual GPS movement:</strong> Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.</li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-best-route-generator-apps-you-should-try-on-samsung-galaxy-m34-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Samsung Galaxy M34 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/6-ways-to-change-spotify-location-on-your-itel-p55-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Itel P55 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/11-best-location-changers-for-realme-gt-5-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>11 Best Location Changers for Realme GT 5 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Samsung Galaxy S23+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-apple-iphone-xr-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Apple iPhone XR | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-honor-magic-6-lite-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Honor Magic 6 Lite | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/11-best-location-changers-for-realme-c55-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>11 Best Location Changers for Realme C55 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-tecno-spark-20-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Tecno Spark 20?

Turn off Your Vivo Y100’s Airplane Mode"></a>2. <strong>Turn off Your Vivo Y100’s Airplane Mode</strong></h3><p>Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.</p><p><strong>For your iOS devices</strong>: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong> owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Detailed-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Review-On-Motorola-Moto-G73-5G"><a href="#A-Detailed-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Review-On-Motorola-Moto-G73-5G" class="headerlink" title="A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Motorola Moto G73 5G"></a>A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Motorola Moto G73 5G</h2><p>As I stumbled upon this query that has been recently posted on a leading online forum, I realized that so many people don’t know about the VPNa Fake GPS app. If you are also an Android user who would like to change your device’s location, then VPNa Fake GPS APK might meet your requirements. Since there are so many location spoofing tools out there, I decided to give VPNa Fake GPS location app a try and have come up with its genuine review here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More"><a href="#Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More"></a>Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More</h2><p>Developed by XdoApp, VPNa Fake GPS is a popular application that can change the location of your Android virtually. Using it, you can spoof your device location to almost anywhere in the world. This would be reflected in almost all the installed gaming, dating, and other apps on your phone automatically.</p><ul><li>You can look for any location on the interface of VPNa Fake GPS by entering keywords (name&#x2F;address) or the exact coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the place.</li><li>To fake GPS using VPNa, you would be presented with a map-like interface and can easily move the pin around to spoof your location to an exact place.</li><li>Besides that, if there is a location that you change frequently, then you can also mark it as a favorite.</li><li>The VPNa fake GPS location APK would also maintain the record of the past locations that you have spoofed.</li><li>Using VPNa Fake GPS, you can change your location as many times as you want without paying anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/vpna/vpna-fake-gps-1.jpg"                      alt="use vpns fake gps"                ></p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><ul><li>The changed location would be reflected in almost every dating and gaming app.</li><li>The basic version of VPNa Fake GPS is available for free and doesn’t need root access.</li><li>The overall interface of VPNa Fake GPS APK is pretty user-friendly and smooth.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Cons</em></strong></p><ul><li>At times, some advanced apps (like Pokemon Go) can detect it and might get your account banned.</li><li>While using the free VPNa fake GPS version, you would get in-app ads.</li><li>Sometimes, the location is not spoofed even after consecutive attempts.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Pricing</em></strong>: While you can access the basic version of VPNa Fake GPS for free, you can pay $2.99 for an ad-free experience.</p><p><strong><em>Compatibility</em></strong>: Android 4.4 and newer versions</p><p><strong><em>Play Store Rating:</em></strong> 3.6&#x2F;5</p><p><strong><em>Important Note</em></strong></p><p>Don’t get confused by the name of VPNa Fake GPS as it is not a VPN, but only a location spoofing solution. If you are looking for a VPN app, then you should consider other options.</p><p><strong><em>Final Verdict</em></strong></p><p>Overall, VPNa Fake GPS location free is worth a try. It is pretty lightweight, easy-to-use, and supports almost all the prominent apps. Since you don’t have to pay anything to use VPNa Fake GPS, you can give it a try, and explore it on your own.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-to-Spoof-Your-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-to-Spoof-Your-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use VPNa Fake GPS Location Free to Spoof Your Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Use VPNa Fake GPS Location Free to Spoof Your Location?</h2><p>Now when you know how VPNa fake GPS Location Free works, let’s quickly understand how to use it to change the location on any Android phone.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Enable-Developer-Options-on-your-phone"><a href="#Step-1-Enable-Developer-Options-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enable Developer Options on your phone"></a><strong>Step 1: Enable Developer Options on your phone</strong></h3><p>To set up a mock location app, you need to first enable the Developer Options on your device.

It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg"                      alt="snap map feature"                ></p><p>This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.</p><p>This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?"></a><strong>Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?</strong></h2><p>The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?</p><p>Yes, Absolutely!</p><p>There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.</p><p><strong>Ghost Mode:</strong> The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg"                      alt="track camera screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg"                      alt="find bitmoji"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location setting on snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg"                      alt="duration ghost mode"                ></p><p>If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.</p><p><strong>Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone</strong></p><p>If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg"                      alt="check location notification tray"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on&#x2F;off.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg" alt="tap location on/off"></p><p><strong>iPhone</strong></p><p>To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg"                      alt="go to setting on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg"                      alt="tap privacy option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg"                      alt="click location services option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg"                      alt="turn off location service"                ></p><p>These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location. You must be knowing how to send location on snapchat through chats - even this won’t be possible once you completely turn off the GPS of your devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat</strong></h2><p>If you are wondering how to fake location on snapchat, then the Snapchat location spoofer is one of the best options. You won’t find a specific software designed exclusively for Snapchat but Wondershare’s Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer will help you hide your real location on social media apps. This is how you use the application.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it. You will find several options on the page. Go for ‘Virtual Location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now connect Your Oppo A79 5G to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: The world map with your current location will show up on the page. The ‘Teleport mode’ is the third icon on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it and enter your new location in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once you’ve decided with your final virtual location to fake gps for snapchat, then click on ‘Move Here’. New location will update in your phone and Snapchat will detect it too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="set the location"                ></p><p>One of the advantages of using a location spoofer is that - your new location will reflect in all social media applications. Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.</p><p><strong>VPN Service - NordVPN</strong></p><p>The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn google play store"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg"                      alt="signup for quick connect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg"                      alt="choose the server"                ></p><p>So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions"></a><strong>Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><p><strong>Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.</p><p><strong>Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?</strong></p><p>A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Conclusion"></a><strong>Part 4: Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success. While the location spoofer stands at the top-spot, using a VPN is the next best thing. If you want to rely on in-built features, know that they aren’t always successful. Make the right choice and keep your location a secret for your own privacy.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/a-detailed-guide-on-faking-your-location-in-mozilla-firefox-on-apple-iphone-se-2020-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On Apple iPhone SE (2020) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-infinix-note-30-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Infinix Note 30 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-oppo-reno-8t-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Oppo Reno 8T 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-on-vivo-x-flip-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 Methods to Turn off Life 360 On Vivo X Flip without Anyone Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-fake-gps-without-root-on-vivo-y36i-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Fake GPS Without Root On Vivo Y36i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-zte-axon-40-lite-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On ZTE Axon 40 Lite | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-zte-nubia-flip-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for ZTE Nubia Flip 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-vivo-v30-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Vivo V30 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-oneplus-ace-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for OnePlus Ace 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-fake-gps-without-root-on-nubia-red-magic-8s-proplus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Fake GPS Without Root On Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-lava-yuva-2-pro-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Lava Yuva 2 Pro?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Detailed-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Review-On-Infinix-Note-30-VIP"><a href="#A-Detailed-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Review-On-Infinix-Note-30-VIP" class="headerlink" title="A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Infinix Note 30 VIP"></a>A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Infinix Note 30 VIP</h2><p>As I stumbled upon this query that has been recently posted on a leading online forum, I realized that so many people don’t know about the VPNa Fake GPS app. If you are also an Android user who would like to change your device’s location, then VPNa Fake GPS APK might meet your requirements. Since there are so many location spoofing tools out there, I decided to give VPNa Fake GPS location app a try and have come up with its genuine review here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More"><a href="#Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More"></a>Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More</h2><p>Developed by XdoApp, VPNa Fake GPS is a popular application that can change the location of your Android virtually. Using it, you can spoof your device location to almost anywhere in the world. This would be reflected in almost all the installed gaming, dating, and other apps on your phone automatically.</p><ul><li>You can look for any location on the interface of VPNa Fake GPS by entering keywords (name&#x2F;address) or the exact coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the place.</li><li>To fake GPS using VPNa, you would be presented with a map-like interface and can easily move the pin around to spoof your location to an exact place.</li><li>Besides that, if there is a location that you change frequently, then you can also mark it as a favorite.</li><li>The VPNa fake GPS location APK would also maintain the record of the past locations that you have spoofed.</li><li>Using VPNa Fake GPS, you can change your location as many times as you want without paying anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/vpna/vpna-fake-gps-1.jpg"                      alt="use vpns fake gps"                ></p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><ul><li>The changed location would be reflected in almost every dating and gaming app.</li><li>The basic version of VPNa Fake GPS is available for free and doesn’t need root access.</li><li>The overall interface of VPNa Fake GPS APK is pretty user-friendly and smooth.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Cons</em></strong></p><ul><li>At times, some advanced apps (like Pokemon Go) can detect it and might get your account banned.</li><li>While using the free VPNa fake GPS version, you would get in-app ads.</li><li>Sometimes, the location is not spoofed even after consecutive attempts.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Pricing</em></strong>: While you can access the basic version of VPNa Fake GPS for free, you can pay $2.99 for an ad-free experience.</p><p><strong><em>Compatibility</em></strong>: Android 4.4 and newer versions</p><p><strong><em>Play Store Rating:</em></strong> 3.6&#x2F;5</p><p><strong><em>Important Note</em></strong></p><p>Don’t get confused by the name of VPNa Fake GPS as it is not a VPN, but only a location spoofing solution. If you are looking for a VPN app, then you should consider other options.</p><p><strong><em>Final Verdict</em></strong></p><p>Overall, VPNa Fake GPS location free is worth a try. It is pretty lightweight, easy-to-use, and supports almost all the prominent apps. Since you don’t have to pay anything to use VPNa Fake GPS, you can give it a try, and explore it on your own.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-to-Spoof-Your-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-to-Spoof-Your-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use VPNa Fake GPS Location Free to Spoof Your Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Use VPNa Fake GPS Location Free to Spoof Your Location?</h2><p>Now when you know how VPNa fake GPS Location Free works, let’s quickly understand how to use it to change the location on any Android phone.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Enable-Developer-Options-on-your-phone"><a href="#Step-1-Enable-Developer-Options-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enable Developer Options on your phone"></a><strong>Step 1: Enable Developer Options on your phone</strong></h3><p>To set up a mock location app, you need to first enable the Developer Options on your device.

Once you change the country’s location on Google Play manually, the Play Store requires 48 hours to accept this modification. Moreover, you can only change the country’s server location once a year. With VPN, many country servers are unreachable, and some servers can be reached only through a paid version. This makes the process expensive and time taking.</p><p>To avoid these hurdles and chaos, we recommend you to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to fake your location on both Android and iOS devices. This tool works in every situation and allows users to travel the globe through their phones free of cost. You can also travel with an exact GPS location just with a single click. Hence, this tool will work amazingly in faking your location without requiring you to change Google Play country’s location.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>Fake location on your phone with a few clicks.</li><li>Support most mainstreaming apps and geo-based games, including Pokemon Go, Snapchat, Tinder, and so on.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>To change country Google Play using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, here are the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose Virtual Location Feature</strong></p><p>Begin with launching the tool of Dr.Fone on your computer.

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Poco X5 Pro device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy. Using the “Privacy Levels” option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg"                      alt="set the privacy levels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using its “Fixed Location” feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the “Marker” on it to change your browser’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg"                      alt="set the fixed location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones"></a>Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones</h2><p>It is not only on computers where you can use Firefox fake location but also on smartphones. You can easily disable or change your Firefox location on your iOS or Android device. Three different methods to disable or change the location in Mozilla Firefox are summarized below:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-Sharing-on-the-Firefox-Browser"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-Sharing-on-the-Firefox-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation Sharing on the Firefox Browser"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation Sharing on the Firefox Browser</h3><p>If you use the Firefox browser on your phone, it allows you to disable your location using a couple of simple steps. Disabling location services for the Firefox browser differs on Android and iOS devices. A detailed step-by-step process for disabling location is given below for both platforms:</p><p><strong>On Android</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Firefox browser on your phone and press the “Three Dots” icon from the bottom right corner. Select “Settings” from the menu and navigate to the “Privacy and Security” section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-11.jpg"                      alt="access the firefox settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, tap “Site Permissions” and select “Location.” In the “Location” option, select “Blocked” to disable the location access on the Firefox browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-12.jpg"                      alt="enable the blocked option"                ></p><p><strong>On iPhone</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your iPhone, open “Settings” and scroll down to “Firefox.” After locating the app, select it and press “Location” on the next screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-13.jpg"                      alt="choose the firefox app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In the “Location” menu, you can select “Never” to completely disable the location access for the Firefox browser. To only stop Firefox from detecting your accurate location, turn off the toggle of the “Precise Location” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-14.jpg"                      alt="disable the firefox ios location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Spoof-Your-Location-in-Firefox-Using-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Spoof-Your-Location-in-Firefox-Using-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Spoof Your Location in Firefox Using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Method 2: Spoof Your Location in Firefox Using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>Nowadays, many websites work with the help of location-based services.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Poco X5 Pro keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works.</em></td><td>4.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try-On-Oppo-K11-5G"><a href="#5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try-On-Oppo-K11-5G" class="headerlink" title="5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Oppo K11 5G"></a>5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Oppo K11 5G</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png"                      alt="change location"                ></p><p>Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg"                      alt="Route Generator App Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?"></a>Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?</h2><p>In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.</p><p>Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try</h2><p>If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:</p><ol><li><strong>Route4Me</strong></li></ol><p>Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices.

The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Oppo K11 5G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="6-Ways-to-Change-Spotify-Location-On-Your-Samsung-Galaxy-F15-5G"><a href="#6-Ways-to-Change-Spotify-Location-On-Your-Samsung-Galaxy-F15-5G" class="headerlink" title="6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G"></a>6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png"                      alt="change location"                ></p><p>Spotify’s booming audio business is proof that people are in love with its services. If you want to listen to your favorite retro song, or you want to discover the latest hits, Spotify has everything. You can also listen to some really good podcasts and album hits. But what most of us don’t know is that your Spotify Location can determine what kind of content you might come across on the platform.</p><p>Your playlist suggestions depend on the country and region you are staying in. And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify</strong></h2><p>Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.</p><p><strong>Region Specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg"                      alt="region specific spotify content"                ></p><p>The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.</p><p><strong>Geo-Based Suggestions</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg"                      alt="sopify playlist"                ></p><p>Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.</p><p><strong>But is Spotify available everywhere?</strong></p><p>How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.</p><p>The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Samsung Galaxy F15 5G keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set.
