Solving the internet issues"></a>1. Solving the internet issues</h3><p>Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.</p><p>If this is the cause of your <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong>, there isn’t much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to “Mapbox” to see if it addresses the problem.</p><h3 id="2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software"><a href="#2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="2. Restarting and Closing the Software"></a>2. Restarting and Closing the Software</h3><p>When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg"                      alt="restart the software"                ></p><h3 id="3-3uTools-reinstallation"><a href="#3-3uTools-reinstallation" class="headerlink" title="3. 3uTools reinstallation"></a>3. 3uTools reinstallation</h3><p>The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg"                      alt="reinstall 3utools"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restarting-Your-Computer"><a href="#4-Restarting-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="4. Restarting Your Computer"></a>4. Restarting Your Computer</h3><p>Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg"                      alt="restart computer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked"><a href="#5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked" class="headerlink" title="5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked"></a>5. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked</h3><p>When you encounter a ‘not working’ problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg"                      alt="verify the netwrok connection"                ></p><h3 id="6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded"><a href="#6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded" class="headerlink" title="6. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded"></a>6. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded</h3><p>Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.</p><h3 id="7-Changing-the-Source-Map"><a href="#7-Changing-the-Source-Map" class="headerlink" title="7. Changing the Source Map"></a>7. Changing the Source Map</h3><p>Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt “Load embedded maps” to solve this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-6.jpg"                      alt="load embedded maps"                ></p><p>Alternatively, change the source map between Google Maps and Open Street Maps.</p><h3 id="8-Uninstalling-iTunes-and-rebooting-your-system"><a href="#8-Uninstalling-iTunes-and-rebooting-your-system" class="headerlink" title="8.

Then, try restarting it. Install iTunes from the App Store once more. Restart your computer. After that, connect your iPhone to a PC and confirm that it is unlocked.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-3uTools-Virtual-Location-Alternative-Program-You-Can-Use-in-2024"><a href="#Part-3-Best-3uTools-Virtual-Location-Alternative-Program-You-Can-Use-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best 3uTools Virtual Location Alternative Program You Can Use in 2024"></a>Part 3: Best 3uTools Virtual Location Alternative Program You Can Use in 2024</h2><p>Stop fretting if you frequently encounter the <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong> problem despite attempting various fixes.

The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.</p><p>As of now, you cannot run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> as it is only available for Android and iOS. <em>Why?</em> Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the <strong><em>Life360 app for Windows</em></strong>. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the <strong><em>Life360 app on Windows</em></strong>.</p><p>So, without wasting another second, let’s dive straight into the guide.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC"><a href="#Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?"></a>Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?</h2><p>First things first; why would anyone want to use a family locator app like Life360 on their PC? Well, the truth is everyone has their own reason to get <strong><em>Life360 for PC</em></strong>. For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.</p><p>In this situation, you can simply run the <strong><em>Life360 app on PC</em></strong>. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.</p><p>Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?"></a>Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?</h2><p>Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.</p><p>The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.</p><p>However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and <strong><em>run the app on a Windows PC</em></strong>. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.</p><p>These methods include:</p><h2 id="Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator"></a>Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator</h2><p>The first and the most convenient way to run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> is to use an Android Emulator. An emulator is basically a software that creates a virtual Android system on your computer. As a result, you’ll be able to run Android apps on your computer.</p><p>While there are dozens of Android emulators, Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and user-friendly option among all. Unlike other emulators, Bluestacks is easy to set up and use.</p><p>Here’s how you can run <strong><em>Life360 on a computer</em></strong> using Bluestacks Android emulator.&#x2F;</p><p>Step 1: Head over to Bluestacks official website and tap the download button.</p><p>Step 2: Open the installer and tap the “download” button. This will initiate the download process on your System.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-1.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 1"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once the installation process completes, Bluestacks will start to boot. Keep in mind that the first boot may take some time, depending on your system configurations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-2.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 2"                ></p><p>Step 4: In the home screen, tap the “Google Play Store” icon. You’ll be asked to sign-in with your Google account. Enter the right credentials and log-in to the Google Play Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-3.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 13"                ></p><p>Step 5: In the top search bar, type-in Life360 and tap the “install” button to download the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-4.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 5"                ></p><p>Step 6: Life360 is now installed on your computer. Open the app and enter your login details. You’ll now be able to run Life360 on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-5.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 5"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Use-Life360-by-mirroring-Android-to-Windows-PC"><a href="#Part-4-Use-Life360-by-mirroring-Android-to-Windows-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Use Life360 by mirroring Android to Windows PC"></a>Part 4: Use Life360 by mirroring Android to Windows PC</h2><p>While running an emulator is a great way to get <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em>,</strong> it has its own set of challenges. For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.</p><p>In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em></strong>. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.</p><p>Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.</p><p>Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 1"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose the “Projecting to this PC” option in the left menu-bar and make sure that “Available Everywhere” is selected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-2.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 2"                ></p><p>Step 4: If you’re running Android Pie or above on your device, scroll down to open notification drawer and select “Smart View” (or “Cast” in some devices). You’ll see your PC listed here. Tap the button to start Android mirroring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-3.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 3"                ></p><p>Step 5: It may take some while for the connection to establish. Once it does, you’ll be able to cast your device screen onto your computer and you’ll be able to run life360 on your system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-4.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 4"                ></p><p>Keep in mind that you’ll still require your device to navigate through the content on your computer. Any action that you perform on your device will be replicated on your computer screen as well.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Life360 is probably among the top family locators for Android users. Apart from its extensive range of features, the app provides a user-friendly interface, which allows it easier for even elders to use the app without any issues. Even though there isn’t a dedicated Life360 software for Windows, you can follow the above-mentioned methods to run the <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em></strong>.</p><h2 id="You-Might-Also-Like"><a href="#You-Might-Also-Like" class="headerlink" title="You Might Also Like"></a>You Might Also Like</h2><h2 id="Location-based-apps"><a href="#Location-based-apps" class="headerlink" title="Location-based apps"></a>Location-based apps</h2><p>GPS spoof for dating apps</p><p>GPS spoof for social apps</p><p>Pokemon Go on PC</p><p>AR game tricks</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/virtual-location-horizontal.png"                      alt="virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Change Phone GPS Location Easily</strong></p><ul><li>● Teleport GPS location to anywhere</li><li>● Play AR games without moving</li><li>● Spoof Location on the popular Apps</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Try Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-honor-magic-v2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Honor Magic V2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-realme-narzo-60-5g-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Realme Narzo 60 5G?

It is an excellent choice for staying updated about family when you have security concerns. Despite this, it can be intrusive when you need your privacy. If you’re a group member and wonder how to turn off Life360 without parents knowing on iPhone and Android devices, you’re in luck. This article will provide you with a complete guide on how to turn off Life 360 without anyone knowing.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Life-360"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Life-360" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Life 360?"></a>Part 1: What is Life 360?</h2><p>Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch. This tracking app makes it easy to trace the location of your loved ones or anyone you want to track. But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png"                      alt="life360 for location sharing"                ></p><p>Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png"                      alt="life360 map showing circles"                ></p><p>Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency. In addition, the app automatically contacts the emergency contacts you added when you do this. However, this doesn’t change that it can get intrusive when you need some privacy. That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.png"                      alt="sending help alert on life360"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing</h2><p>There are times when you want to turn Life360 off without it showing so that people don’t know your present location. But, if you have no idea how to go about it, you’re in luck. This section covers the best methods to stop sharing your location with friends and family on Life360.</p><h3 id="1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360"><a href="#1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360"></a>1. <strong>Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360</strong></h3><p>There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.</p><ul><li>First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.</li><li>Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png"                      alt="locate the circle on life360"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on ‘location sharing’ and click on the slider next to it to disable location sharing.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.jpg"                      alt="click on location sharing"                ></p><ul><li>Now you can recheck the map, and it will show ‘location sharing paused.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-Your-Vivo-S17’s-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-off-Your-Vivo-S17’s-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn off Your Vivo S17’s Airplane Mode"></a>2. <strong>Turn off Your Vivo S17’s Airplane Mode</strong></h3><p>Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.</p><p><strong>For your iOS devices</strong>: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong> owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3.

If you want some privacy or don’t trust members of your circle, you might want to learn how to turn off Life 360.

For this, you can take help of an Android spoofer app. There are plenty of them available in Play Store. We will be using “Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer Free”. This is how to fake location on Find My Friends on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To use this, you don’t need to jailbreak or root your device until your Android is running on 6 and higher versions.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to Play Store and search for the app. Install it after downloading.</p><p>When you install it rightly, this is how to do a little twisting to set it up with Find My Friends.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To spoof people about the location, enable the developer settings in the first place. Simply head to “Settings” for this and go to “About Phone”.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In the “Software Info”, you will see a build number. Tap on it nearly 6-7 times. The Developers options will be enabled now. This step is important because it will alter the security settings in your phone. As a result, tricking about the location will become easier.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When developer options are enabled, launch the app. You will see an “ENABLE” option at the bottom. Tap on it to turn on mock locations feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/enable-mock-location.jpg"                      alt="mock locations feature"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Under the Developer options page, click on “Select mock location app”. Now, select “FakeGPS Free” from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/select-mock-location-app.jpg"                      alt="Select mock location app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Return to Fake GPS Free and long press the two spots on map to set the route.

This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Infinix-Note-30-VIP-Racing-Edition-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Infinix-Note-30-VIP-Racing-Edition-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services.

When your starting point is close to the ending point, a pop-up asks if you want to set up a circle route. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to create a circular path on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png"                      alt="try setting a circle route"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Realistic-Mode-For-One-Stop-Route-and-Multi-Stop-Route"><a href="#Part-2-Realistic-Mode-For-One-Stop-Route-and-Multi-Stop-Route" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)"></a>Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)</h3><p>This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation.

Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/fluctuation-mode.png"                      alt="apply fluctuation mode"                ></p><h3 id="Part-4-Cooldown-Timer-For-Teleport-Mode-and-Jump-Teleport-Mode"><a href="#Part-4-Cooldown-Timer-For-Teleport-Mode-and-Jump-Teleport-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)"></a>Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)</h3><p>While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the <strong>Cooldown Timer</strong> on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png"                      alt="try cooldown timer to avoid bans"                ></p><p>It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the <strong>Auto jump after cooldown</strong> in the <strong>Jump teleport mode</strong> after turning on the Cooldown Timer.</p><p>This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.</p><h3 id="Part-5-Import-Export-GPX-File"><a href="#Part-5-Import-Export-GPX-File" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Import&#x2F;Export GPX File"></a>Part 5: Import&#x2F;Export GPX File</h3><p>You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files.

A free VPN service, HolaVPN, can be used to change your IP location to unblock Pokémon Go in these areas.</p><h3 id="1-What-is-HolaVPN"><a href="#1-What-is-HolaVPN" class="headerlink" title="1. What is HolaVPN?"></a>1. What is HolaVPN?</h3><p>HolaVPN is a VPN service that reroutes your internet traffic and hides your IP address. Unlike the Hola Fake GPS, the bandwidth and encryption levels allotted with the HolaVPN service are significant. Plus, it does not alter the location of a chosen application but all the applications on the internet. This means you can play Pokémon from any part of the world, access YouTube from another region, and so on.</p><h3 id="2-Why-Use-HolaVPN-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#2-Why-Use-HolaVPN-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="2.

But if you are simply looking to access a restricted website because of IP location, HolaVPN can be helpful.</p><p>However, it is unsuitable for long-time use. For instance, Hola Fake GPS is known to monitor your online activity and collect information about you. So, it is best to use an advanced application like the Dr.Fone - Virtual Location as shown. As mentioned, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location uses the most advanced technology to spoof your GPS location, so apps like Pokémon Go can’t find your actual GPS location.</p><p>Overall, if you are looking for the ultimate tool to spoof your GPS location, then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the best way to go.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-lava-yuva-3-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Lava Yuva 3 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-samsung-galaxy-a23-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Samsung Galaxy A23 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-nokia-c22-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Nokia C22 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-oneplus-11-5g-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On OnePlus 11 5G?

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store.

We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use.

People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option.

If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region.

If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change "                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal.

Can It Be Detected?</h2><p>One of the most frequent and completely understandable concern and question on people’s minds when they talk about location spoofing is whether is it safe to mock location whether it can be detected and what the consequences are.</p><p>Answer: Location spoofing is safe and will go undetected as long as it is done sensibly and with the right mock location app on your iPhone and Android. You have nothing to worry about as long as you do not be particularly obvious about location mocking. This means that you should take care not to be hopping like a bunny from here and there in minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Top-Mock-Location-Apps-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-III-Top-Mock-Location-Apps-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone"></a>Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone</h2><p>There are fewer mock location apps on the Apple Store due to Apple’s strict policies on user privacy and security.

Therefore, this part will mainly introduce five softwares that need to be installed on a computer. Let’s come to the apps!

How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.</p><p>- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.</p><p>- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.</p><h2 id="Closing-Words"><a href="#Closing-Words" class="headerlink" title="Closing Words"></a>Closing Words</h2><p>Using a mock location app can be fun. You can use it for recreational purposes such as pranking friends. You can use it for practical purposes such as saving money on dating apps by mocking location on Android and iPhones to anywhere around the world to meet new people.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Realme 12+ 5G ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Realme 12+ 5G device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Realme 12+ 5G device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Realme 12+ 5G device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Realme 12+ 5G device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Realme 12+ 5G device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Realme 12+ 5G device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Realme-12-5G-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Realme-12-5G-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Realme 12+ 5G  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Realme 12+ 5G  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Realme 12+ 5G  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Realme-12-5G-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Realme-12-5G-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Realme 12+ 5G  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Realme 12+ 5G  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings.

Please contact your cellular carrier and try again”. This message indicates that your phone is not connected to the internet.</p><p>As a result, your contacts, photos, and messages are not showing. Life360 may be using cellular data instead of Wi-Fi, but it’s not certain. To avoid this, let us read what we should know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-Life360-Location-Wrong"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-Life360-Location-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?"></a>Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?</h2><h3 id="Interference-From-Nearby-Devices-Networks"><a href="#Interference-From-Nearby-Devices-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Interference From Nearby Devices&#x2F;Networks"></a>Interference From Nearby Devices&#x2F;Networks</h3><p>In some cases, Life360 may not be able to determine the location of your device because it is being interfered with by other nearby devices or networks. For example, if you have an iPhone or iPad, it may be using the same cell tower as your Realme 12+ 5G.</p><p>The Life360 app has to use the closest available cell tower to determine your location. So if another device uses the closest tower, Life360 will use that instead.</p><h3 id="Poor-Signal"><a href="#Poor-Signal" class="headerlink" title="Poor Signal"></a>Poor Signal</h3><p>A poor signal in a particular region, particularly if you’re commuting, is the most common cause of Life360’s incorrect location.

If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go"                ></p><p>Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of “catching them all.”</p><p>‘Spoofing’ location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you’re in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-Pgsharp-legal"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Pgsharp-legal" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?"></a><strong>Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp"                ></p><p>No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways.

Hence, any apps like PGSharp, or Fake GPS Go, used to disguise actual real-time location and fake it, will result in an account ban.</p><p> According to Niantic’s terms and conditions:</p><ul><li>“Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device’s location (for example through GPS spoofing).</li><li>And _”_Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software).”</li></ul><p> If Niantic detects usage of a fake location or GPS spoofing app while playing Pokémon Go, they will impose a strike on your account.</p><ul><li>The first strike would make rare Pokémon s not visible to you for seven days.</li><li>The second strike would temporarily ban you from playing the game for 30 Days.</li><li>The third strike will permanently ban your account.</li></ul><p> You can appeal these strikes to Niantic if you think you’ve been banned without violation of any terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/niantic-warning.jpg"                      alt="niantic-warning"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-ways-to-spoof-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Three-ways-to-spoof-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android"></a><strong><strong>Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android</strong></strong></h2><ol><li><strong>PGSharp :</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp-interface.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp-interface"                ></p><p>PGSharp is one of the most reliable ways to spoof your location while playing Pokémon Go.

However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.</p><p>Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select “Virtual Location” given on the first page of the program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select “Get Started”. Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Enable the “teleport mode” by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone’s GPS to in the text box in the map’s left-upper section. Select “Go”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now select “Move here.” And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device. To confirm, open the maps app on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Pro-Tips:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.</li><li>Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-xiaomi-redmi-12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Xiaomi Redmi 12 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-fake-gps-without-root-on-apple-iphone-13-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>3 Ways to Fake GPS Without Root On Apple iPhone 13 mini | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-poco-m6-pro-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Poco M6 Pro 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-tactical-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/11-best-location-changers-for-gionee-f3-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>11 Best Location Changers for Gionee F3 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-vivo-s18-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Vivo S18?

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy. Using the “Privacy Levels” option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg"                      alt="set the privacy levels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using its “Fixed Location” feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the “Marker” on it to change your browser’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg"                      alt="set the fixed location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones"></a>Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones</h2><p>It is not only on computers where you can use Firefox fake location but also on smartphones. You can easily disable or change your Firefox location on your iOS or Android device. Three different methods to disable or change the location in Mozilla Firefox are summarized below:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-Sharing-on-the-Firefox-Browser"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-Sharing-on-the-Firefox-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation Sharing on the Firefox Browser"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation Sharing on the Firefox Browser</h3><p>If you use the Firefox browser on your phone, it allows you to disable your location using a couple of simple steps. Disabling location services for the Firefox browser differs on Android and iOS devices.

It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.</p><p>The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work.

We have provided some user reviews below to help you out:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Reviewer</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bobby Nichols</td><td>“I was using a different app for quite some time. However, if My Oppo A1 5G was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Oppo A1 5G sit untouched for an hour….. YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!”</td></tr><tr><td>Brian Thompson.</td><td>“Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren’t available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you’d charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user.”</td></tr><tr><td>Gerald</td><td>“It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone? Also very sluggish.”</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-Fake-GPS-Location-Pro"><a href="#Part-4-Pros-and-Cons-of-Fake-GPS-Location-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Pros and Cons of Fake GPS Location Pro"></a>Part 4: Pros and Cons of Fake GPS Location Pro</h2><p>We will now discuss some advantages and disadvantages of using <strong>Fake GPS Pro</strong> for spoofing locations on Android devices.

If you want to listen to your favorite retro song, or you want to discover the latest hits, Spotify has everything. You can also listen to some really good podcasts and album hits. But what most of us don’t know is that your Spotify Location can determine what kind of content you might come across on the platform.</p><p>Your playlist suggestions depend on the country and region you are staying in. And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify</strong></h2><p>Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.</p><p><strong>Region Specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg"                      alt="region specific spotify content"                ></p><p>The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.</p><p><strong>Geo-Based Suggestions</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg"                      alt="sopify playlist"                ></p><p>Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.</p><p><strong>But is Spotify available everywhere?</strong></p><p>How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.</p><p>The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone"></a><strong>Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone</strong></h2><p>Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content.

The software is also available in different versions to choose for your device model. You won’t need a computer for this and everything happens over your iPhone only.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Locationfaker version suitable for your phone. Locationfaker8 is available for the 8.0 version of iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-locationfaker-version-app-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download locationfaker"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will notice a map appear on the screen. You can either move your pin-point to the new location or enter the address or coordinates into the search box on top of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/toggle-off-and-on-pic10.jpg"                      alt="map toggle off and on"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you settle with the coordinates, shift the ‘Off’ toggle to ‘On’.

This is usually a very good choice for those people who play games and like to fool their friends with a fake location. However, for Spotify update Location, it still does a great job.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You can download the Location Handle application either from their website or the app store. Wait till it completely installs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-location-handle-app-pic13.jpg"                      alt="ydia location handle app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, the map tab will appear along with an option to choose from 4 location changing types.</p><p><strong>Cydia - Location Handle App</strong></p><ul><li>Normal Mode - Change the location to anywhere</li><li>Offset Mode - Change to a location that is only a few feet away.</li><li>Automatic mode - Change to a new location slowly, as if you were walking.</li><li>Manual Mode - change to a new location by using the joystick to navigate.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/choose-the-mode-for-spoofing-pic14.jpg"                      alt="choose mode for spoofing"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Here, we are learning how to achieve Manual Spotify Change Region.

You can say it as a location-sharing application. This app can be used to share the location of each other among the friends. When your contacts install the app on their device, the application makes everyone eligible to share their location with you and you can too share the location with your friends.</p><p>It is helpful if you are having a hang out plan with your friends. And if you friend is on the way, he or she can share their location. Or it is a great way to catch if someone is lying about their location.</p><h2 id="Part-1-About-Find-My-Friends-app"><a href="#Part-1-About-Find-My-Friends-app" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: About Find My Friends app"></a>Part 1: About Find My Friends app</h2><p>When location sharing is enabled in the Itel S23 device, the map will show the current locations.

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox.

There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Itel S23 device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option.

It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try-On-Lava-Blaze-Pro-5G"><a href="#5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try-On-Lava-Blaze-Pro-5G" class="headerlink" title="5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Lava Blaze Pro 5G"></a>5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Lava Blaze Pro 5G</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png"                      alt="change location"                ></p><p>Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg"                      alt="Route Generator App Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?"></a>Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?</h2><p>In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.</p><p>Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try</h2><p>If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:</p><ol><li><strong>Route4Me</strong></li></ol><p>Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Xiaomi 14 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Xiaomi 14 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Xiaomi 14 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Xiaomi 14 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Xiaomi 14 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Xiaomi 14 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Xiaomi 14 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Xiaomi-14-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Xiaomi-14-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Xiaomi 14  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Xiaomi 14  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Xiaomi 14  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Xiaomi-14-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Xiaomi-14-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Xiaomi 14  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Xiaomi 14  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Xiaomi 14  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Xiaomi 14  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it.

If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go"                ></p><p>Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of “catching them all.”</p><p>‘Spoofing’ location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you’re in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-Pgsharp-legal"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Pgsharp-legal" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?"></a><strong>Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp"                ></p><p>No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways.

However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.</p><p>Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select “Virtual Location” given on the first page of the program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now, have your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max connected to your computer. Then select “Get Started”. Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Enable the “teleport mode” by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone’s GPS to in the text box in the map’s left-upper section. Select “Go”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now select “Move here.” And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device.

The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt.

You can say it as a location-sharing application. This app can be used to share the location of each other among the friends. When your contacts install the app on their device, the application makes everyone eligible to share their location with you and you can too share the location with your friends.</p><p>It is helpful if you are having a hang out plan with your friends. And if you friend is on the way, he or she can share their location. Or it is a great way to catch if someone is lying about their location.</p><h2 id="Part-1-About-Find-My-Friends-app"><a href="#Part-1-About-Find-My-Friends-app" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: About Find My Friends app"></a>Part 1: About Find My Friends app</h2><p>When location sharing is enabled in the Vivo Y200 device, the map will show the current locations. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/find-my-friends/" >Find My Friends app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also has an inbuilt chat option where you can contact your friend and interact about with them. It also automatically informs you when your friend reaches at the target location, leave a location etc. You can customize and configure the alerts as per your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/find-my-friends-intro.jpg"                      alt="Find My Friends app"                ></p><h3 id="How-it-is-different-in-iOS-13"><a href="#How-it-is-different-in-iOS-13" class="headerlink" title="How it is different in iOS 13"></a>How it is different in iOS 13</h3><p>You can find yourself confused if you are using iOS 13 and looking for Find My Friends app. You may not be able to find it on your device running on iOS 13. To your information, Apple has decided to combine the Find My iPhone and Find My Friends app into one. And they have named it as “Find My”. This new named app has everything what Find My Friends and Find My iPhone has. When you’ll open it, you will find the “People” tab on the bottom. Using this, you can get your friends as you used to get before.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/find-my-friends-ios-13.jpg"                      alt="Find My Friends on iOS 13"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Against-Voices-of-the-Find-My-Friends-App"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Against-Voices-of-the-Find-My-Friends-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Against Voices of the Find My Friends App?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Against Voices of the Find My Friends App?</h2><p>Look at some of the things we feel not beneficial about Find My Friends.</p><ul><li>No doubt you can have great advantage of an app that can tell you location of your friends, fiancée or spouse. However, the app is not free. You need to pay a small amount of 99 cents to use this.</li><li>Another thing that might bother you is that there are a lot of people who will be knowing where you exactly are. And this could be a little annoying.</li><li>Also, it is possible to get unnecessary requests from the unknown people. This can also be bothersome.</li><li>Apart from this, the app if in wrong hands like an abuser can be used for wrong purposes and harmful for their partners.</li><li>Not to forget, hackers are everywhere and the app is prone to get accessed by any of them.</li></ul><p>In such cases, the need of hiding or faking Find My Friends location rises.

Mobile Legends is a game that can be played by a few people simultaneously, and it is called MOBA.</p><p>Unlike other games, Mobile Legends allows its players to hide their actual location. Therefore, ML players have many reasons to <strong>fake GPS Mobile Legends,</strong> such as getting a higher rank and playing with their friends wherever they are.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try-On-Vivo-Y27s"><a href="#5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try-On-Vivo-Y27s" class="headerlink" title="5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Vivo Y27s"></a>5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Vivo Y27s</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png"                      alt="change location"                ></p><p>Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg"                      alt="Route Generator App Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?"></a>Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?</h2><p>In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline.
