This is the fastest algorithm available to a user.</td></tr><tr><td>Pseudo-random (1 Pass)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting an entire device with randomly generated numbers in a single pass.</td></tr><tr><td>US Department of Defense, DoD 5220.22-M (3 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting the device in three passes. In the first pass, it overwrites data with zeros, then in the second pass, it overwrites the data with ones, and finally in the third pass overwrites the data with randomly generated bytes. This is a U.S. Department of Defense algorithm.</td></tr><tr><td>US Department of Defense, DoD 5200.22-M (ECE) (7 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting the device in seven passes. The first, fourth, and fifth pass are overwriting with a random byte, its 8 right-bit shift complement, and 16 right-bit shift complement; second and sixth passes are overwriting with zeros, and third and seventh pass with random data. This is a U.S. Department of Defense algorithm.</td></tr><tr><td>B.Schneier’s algorithm (7 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data in seven passes. In the first two passes, it overwrites the device with ones and then zeros, and in the next five passes, it overwrites data with random characters.</td></tr><tr><td>Peter Gutmann (35 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting it 35 times, making recovery of the wiped data by any tool impossible. This algorithm takes more time than other wiping algorithms.</td></tr><tr><td>US-Army AR 380-19 (3 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting the media in three passes. In the first pass, it overwrites data with random bytes, then in the second and third pass, it overwrites data with certain bytes and their complements. This is a U.S. Army algorithm.</td></tr><tr><td>US Air Force, AFSSI 5020(3 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting the media in three passes. First, it overwrites with zeros, then with ones, and finally with random characters.</td></tr><tr><td>British HMG IS5 (3 passes)</td><td>This algorithm is a three pass overwriting algorithm, first pass - with zeros, the second pass–with ones and the last pass with random data.</td></tr></tbody></table><p> 9.

Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1"                ></p><p>However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?</p><p>You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Does-iSpoofer-Still-Work-Why"><a href="#Part-1-Does-iSpoofer-Still-Work-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?"></a><strong>Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?</strong></h2><p>If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2"                ></p><p>Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.</p><p>One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3"                ></p><p>iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.</p><p>So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4"                ></p><p>There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely"><a href="#Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?"></a><strong>Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?</strong></h2><p>If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Nokia C12 Pro device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.</p><p>If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -</p><p><strong>VPNs</strong> - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5"                ></p><p><strong>Apps on App Store</strong> - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Honor Magic V2 keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set.

When any task that we plan to do, usually already have an application released for the sole purpose of doing that task and needing to do it on your phone. When we message our friends, have a video call with our family, or just simply order food to eat at home, you can do all of them on the Itel A60s device in your palm.</p><p>Another advantage of having our phones with us all the time is that you can also see the current location of either your friend or family. For Apple phone users, they have an app that is called “Find My Friends” that will show you the locations of the people that you are tracking. But what if you cannot find the location of the friend?

This could also be another common reason why you cannot see their location.</p><p><em><strong>Option #3:</strong></em> Make sure that their “Location Services” is turned on. Some users would turn this feature off which hinders the application from checking their current location.</p><p><em><strong>Option #4:</strong></em> The other user must have set up the wrong date and time.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Xiaomi Redmi 12 keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works.</em></td><td>4.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115916/19272" target="_top" id="2115916">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115916" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115916/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Infinix Note 30 VIP devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

Click <strong>Yes</strong> to create a circular path on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png"                      alt="try setting a circle route"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Realistic-Mode-For-One-Stop-Route-and-Multi-Stop-Route"><a href="#Part-2-Realistic-Mode-For-One-Stop-Route-and-Multi-Stop-Route" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)"></a>Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)</h3><p>This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation. If you wish to turn on realistic mode for the one-stop or multi-stop route, look for the respective checkmark option in the panel on the left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/realistic-mode.png"                      alt="use realistic mode for accuracy"                ></p><h3 id="Part-3-Fluctuation-Mode-For-Teleport-Mode"><a href="#Part-3-Fluctuation-Mode-For-Teleport-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fluctuation Mode (For Teleport Mode)"></a>Part 3: Fluctuation Mode (For Teleport Mode)</h3><p>Whenever you are teleporting your smartphone device to another location, you can try using the fluctuation mode feature offered against it. As you activate <strong>Teleport Mode</strong> from the top-right section and search for a location, you will discover the <strong>Fluctuation Mode</strong> toggle in the confirmation tab. Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/fluctuation-mode.png"                      alt="apply fluctuation mode"                ></p><h3 id="Part-4-Cooldown-Timer-For-Teleport-Mode-and-Jump-Teleport-Mode"><a href="#Part-4-Cooldown-Timer-For-Teleport-Mode-and-Jump-Teleport-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)"></a>Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)</h3><p>While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the <strong>Cooldown Timer</strong> on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png"                      alt="try cooldown timer to avoid bans"                ></p><p>It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the <strong>Auto jump after cooldown</strong> in the <strong>Jump teleport mode</strong> after turning on the Cooldown Timer.</p><p>This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.</p><h3 id="Part-5-Import-Export-GPX-File"><a href="#Part-5-Import-Export-GPX-File" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Import&#x2F;Export GPX File"></a>Part 5: Import&#x2F;Export GPX File</h3><p>You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files.

This article will provide you with a complete guide on how to turn off Life 360 without anyone knowing.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Life-360"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Life-360" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Life 360?"></a>Part 1: What is Life 360?</h2><p>Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch. This tracking app makes it easy to trace the location of your loved ones or anyone you want to track. But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png"                      alt="life360 for location sharing"                ></p><p>Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png"                      alt="life360 map showing circles"                ></p><p>Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency.

That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.png"                      alt="sending help alert on life360"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing</h2><p>There are times when you want to turn Life360 off without it showing so that people don’t know your present location.

Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360"></a>1. <strong>Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360</strong></h3><p>There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.</p><ul><li>First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.</li><li>Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png"                      alt="locate the circle on life360"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on ‘location sharing’ and click on the slider next to it to disable location sharing.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.jpg"                      alt="click on location sharing"                ></p><ul><li>Now you can recheck the map, and it will show ‘location sharing paused.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-Your-OnePlus-12’s-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-off-Your-OnePlus-12’s-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn off Your OnePlus 12’s Airplane Mode"></a>2. <strong>Turn off Your OnePlus 12’s Airplane Mode</strong></h3><p>Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.</p><p><strong>For your iOS devices</strong>: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong> owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3.

But if you’re really eager to get hold of the restricted Netflix show, try to modify your device’s primary location. Don’t worry. There are many tutorials online on how to change your Netflix location. Just choose one and follow the instructions indicated.</p><h3 id="The-Netflix-show-has-varying-release-dates-for-each-region"><a href="#The-Netflix-show-has-varying-release-dates-for-each-region" class="headerlink" title="The Netflix show has varying release dates for each region"></a>The Netflix show has varying release dates for each region</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-3.JPG"                      alt="netflix show release date"                ></p><p>Maybe there is no complicated issue behind the geo-blocking of a particular Netflix show in your region.

To help you out, below is the list of methods you can try.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Activate-VPN-before-streaming-Netflix-shows"><a href="#Method-1-Activate-VPN-before-streaming-Netflix-shows" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Activate VPN before streaming Netflix shows"></a>Method 1: Activate VPN before streaming Netflix shows</h3><p>Virtual Private Networks generally mask your IP address by directing your internet traffic to a server from a different location. Thus, your location settings show modified coordinates whenever you browse the internet with a VPN enabled. That also works with streaming Netflix shows that are currently restricted in your region. Do you want to try it? Here’s a short guide on how to change your location on Netflix using Virtual Private Networks.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First and foremost, check the current standing of your Netflix account and make sure it is active. Once confirmed, choose your preferred VPN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-4.jpg"                      alt="active netflix account"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Then, download and install your selected Virtual Private Network. Register an account afterward and subscribe to a paid plan if necessary.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Activate the VPN on your device. From there, choose a country where you wish to direct your internet traffic.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-5.jpg"                      alt="connect to vpn"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once successfully activated, you can now access Netflix on your device and search for the restricted TV show you want to watch.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-Stream-Netflix-shows-with-a-web-proxy-server"><a href="#Method-2-Stream-Netflix-shows-with-a-web-proxy-server" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Stream Netflix shows with a web proxy server"></a>Method 2: Stream Netflix shows with a web proxy server</h3><p>For the most part, a web proxy server basically works like a Virtual Private Network. It reroutes your internet traffic to a particular server from a different location. Through this tactic, Netflix fails to detect that you’re using its service from a restricted region. A web proxy server is often free of charge. Thus, it’s a great alternative to VPNs if you don’t want to spend money just to access unavailable content on your device. Do you want to try it now? Here’s how to change your Netflix location using a web proxy server.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose your preferred web proxy server and then visit its official website. Create an account if necessary.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, select a server from the available options. Make sure that the server you’re going to choose is not geologically blocklisted on Netflix.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-6.jpg"                      alt="select a server"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the official web address of Netflix into the URL bar and then proceed immediately.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait while the web proxy server is loading up your request. After a few minutes, the Netflix dashboard must be displayed on your computer screen. From there, you can now browse its catalog and binge-watch the content currently restricted in your region. That’s exactly how to change your location on Netflix with a web proxy server.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-7.jpg"                      alt="stream netflix"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stream-Netflix-shows-from-the-Tor-browser"><a href="#Method-3-Stream-Netflix-shows-from-the-Tor-browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stream Netflix shows from the Tor browser"></a>Method 3: Stream Netflix shows from the Tor browser</h3><p>Tor browser is primarily used for ultra-private internet browsing. Your online activities on this platform are encrypted and directed to about three various servers located worldwide. Although you cannot actually change your location settings, your actual IP address will be masked and routed somewhere else. This way, you get a higher chance of accessing restricted Netflix shows from the comfort of your own home. Do you want to try it now? Here’s the guide on how to change your Netflix region using the Tor browser.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download Tor browser from its <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/"><u>official website.</u></a> After that, install it on your computer.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Launch the Tor browser on your desktop and hit <strong>Connect.</strong> Make sure that Tor has been successfully configured on your device.

If you’re not patient enough, you might struggle to stream Netflix shows on this platform.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Google Pixel 8 devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Google Pixel 8 keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works.</em></td><td>4.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.</p><p>As of now, you cannot run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> as it is only available for Android and iOS. <em>Why?</em> Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the <strong><em>Life360 app for Windows</em></strong>. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the <strong><em>Life360 app on Windows</em></strong>.</p><p>So, without wasting another second, let’s dive straight into the guide.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC"><a href="#Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?"></a>Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?</h2><p>First things first; why would anyone want to use a family locator app like Life360 on their PC? Well, the truth is everyone has their own reason to get <strong><em>Life360 for PC</em></strong>. For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.</p><p>In this situation, you can simply run the <strong><em>Life360 app on PC</em></strong>. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.</p><p>Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?"></a>Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?</h2><p>Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones.

If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2"                ></p><p>Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.</p><p>One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3"                ></p><p>iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.</p><p>So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely"><a href="#Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?"></a><strong>Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?</strong></h2><p>If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Nokia C12 device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.</p><p>If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -</p><p><strong>VPNs</strong> - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5"                ></p><p><strong>Apps on App Store</strong> - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896532/19272" target="_top" id="1896532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896532/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you are looking for a sure shot at changing your location without any hassle, then the best suggestion would be to use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Changer.

You can say it as a location-sharing application. This app can be used to share the location of each other among the friends. When your contacts install the app on their device, the application makes everyone eligible to share their location with you and you can too share the location with your friends.</p><p>It is helpful if you are having a hang out plan with your friends. And if you friend is on the way, he or she can share their location. Or it is a great way to catch if someone is lying about their location.</p><h2 id="Part-1-About-Find-My-Friends-app"><a href="#Part-1-About-Find-My-Friends-app" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: About Find My Friends app"></a>Part 1: About Find My Friends app</h2><p>When location sharing is enabled in the Itel P40 device, the map will show the current locations. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/find-my-friends/" >Find My Friends app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also has an inbuilt chat option where you can contact your friend and interact about with them.

To your information, Apple has decided to combine the Find My iPhone and Find My Friends app into one. And they have named it as “Find My”.

However, the app is not free. You need to pay a small amount of 99 cents to use this.</li><li>Another thing that might bother you is that there are a lot of people who will be knowing where you exactly are. And this could be a little annoying.</li><li>Also, it is possible to get unnecessary requests from the unknown people.

For this, you can take help of an Android spoofer app. There are plenty of them available in Play Store. We will be using “Fake GPS GO Location Spoofer Free”. This is how to fake location on Find My Friends on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To use this, you don’t need to jailbreak or root your device until your Android is running on 6 and higher versions.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to Play Store and search for the app. Install it after downloading.</p><p>When you install it rightly, this is how to do a little twisting to set it up with Find My Friends.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To spoof people about the location, enable the developer settings in the first place. Simply head to “Settings” for this and go to “About Phone”.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In the “Software Info”, you will see a build number. Tap on it nearly 6-7 times. The Developers options will be enabled now. This step is important because it will alter the security settings in your phone. As a result, tricking about the location will become easier.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When developer options are enabled, launch the app. You will see an “ENABLE” option at the bottom. Tap on it to turn on mock locations feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/enable-mock-location.jpg"                      alt="mock locations feature"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Under the Developer options page, click on “Select mock location app”.

For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137972/21526" target="_top" id="2137972">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137972" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137972/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043603/7443" target="_top" id="2043603">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043603" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043603/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options.

Since there are so many location spoofing tools out there, I decided to give VPNa Fake GPS location app a try and have come up with its genuine review here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More"><a href="#Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More"></a>Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More</h2><p>Developed by XdoApp, VPNa Fake GPS is a popular application that can change the location of your Android virtually. Using it, you can spoof your device location to almost anywhere in the world. This would be reflected in almost all the installed gaming, dating, and other apps on your phone automatically.</p><ul><li>You can look for any location on the interface of VPNa Fake GPS by entering keywords (name&#x2F;address) or the exact coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the place.</li><li>To fake GPS using VPNa, you would be presented with a map-like interface and can easily move the pin around to spoof your location to an exact place.</li><li>Besides that, if there is a location that you change frequently, then you can also mark it as a favorite.</li><li>The VPNa fake GPS location APK would also maintain the record of the past locations that you have spoofed.</li><li>Using VPNa Fake GPS, you can change your location as many times as you want without paying anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/vpna/vpna-fake-gps-1.jpg"                      alt="use vpns fake gps"                ></p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><ul><li>The changed location would be reflected in almost every dating and gaming app.</li><li>The basic version of VPNa Fake GPS is available for free and doesn’t need root access.</li><li>The overall interface of VPNa Fake GPS APK is pretty user-friendly and smooth.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Cons</em></strong></p><ul><li>At times, some advanced apps (like Pokemon Go) can detect it and might get your account banned.</li><li>While using the free VPNa fake GPS version, you would get in-app ads.</li><li>Sometimes, the location is not spoofed even after consecutive attempts.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Pricing</em></strong>: While you can access the basic version of VPNa Fake GPS for free, you can pay $2.99 for an ad-free experience.</p><p><strong><em>Compatibility</em></strong>: Android 4.4 and newer versions</p><p><strong><em>Play Store Rating:</em></strong> 3.6&#x2F;5</p><p><strong><em>Important Note</em></strong></p><p>Don’t get confused by the name of VPNa Fake GPS as it is not a VPN, but only a location spoofing solution.

Here’s what users have to say about the Hola Fake GPS application:</p><p><strong>Vikas Divyakirti on G2 Says:</strong></p><p>“Hola Fake GPS is a great service for anyone looking for a simple and location-changer application. The interface is really simple to use, and the time spent on the app is always a seamless experience. The security features offered are not that top-notch, but if you are looking for a free application just to change your location, then Hola Fake GPS is the way to go.”</p><p><strong>Sheron on G2 Writes:</strong></p><p>“Hola Fake GPS has been a disappointing experience for me, and I’m pretty sure it will be for you. The attractive pricing and fast speed promise seem like it is the best location spoofer on the internet, but believe me, any other service on the internet is better than this. The company now constantly gets negative feedback from the giants like Google for its privacy violation. Overall, I would ask you not to download Hola Fake GPS app.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884021/19272" target="_top" id="1884021">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884021" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884021/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Is-Fake-GPS-location-Hola-Safe"><a href="#Part-4-Is-Fake-GPS-location-Hola-Safe" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Is Fake GPS location - Hola Safe?"></a>Part 4. Is Fake GPS location - Hola Safe?</h2><p>No. There is no grey area here. For years, the Hola Fake GPS Android app has been marked as one of the worst apps to change your location. It explicitly collects users’ data, monitors users’ activity, and sells them to third-party vendors that track you online.</p><p>Moreover, the accessible version of Hola Fake GPS isn’t even encrypted, so there is always a chance of a man-in-the-middle attack, and so on.</p><p>Not to forget, Hola Fake GPS and its parent app, the HolaVPN, have also been removed from the Chrome Web Store numerous times. Additionally, it has a long history of controversies. So, it is only better to look for alternatives to Hola Fake GPS.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Comparison-of-Fake-GPS-location-Hola-and-Its-Competitor-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-5-Comparison-of-Fake-GPS-location-Hola-and-Its-Competitor-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.
