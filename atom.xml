Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Oppo K11 5G device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy. Using the “Privacy Levels” option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg"                      alt="set the privacy levels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using its “Fixed Location” feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the “Marker” on it to change your browser’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg"                      alt="set the fixed location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones"></a>Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones</h2><p>It is not only on computers where you can use Firefox fake location but also on smartphones.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="8-Solutions-to-Fix-‘Find-My-Friends-Location-Not-Available’-On-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#8-Solutions-to-Fix-‘Find-My-Friends-Location-Not-Available’-On-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="8 Solutions to Fix ‘Find My Friends Location Not Available’ On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max"></a>8 Solutions to Fix ‘Find My Friends Location Not Available’ On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</h2><p>There is no doubt that Find My Friends is an excellent application for location tracking. It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Apple" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> iPhone 15 Pro Max .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends"></a>Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends</h3><p>Another tip that can help you resolve to <strong>Find My Friends location not available</strong> is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn’t logged into the feature, you won’t access his&#x2F;her location.</p><p>Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again"><a href="#Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again"></a>Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again</h3><p>Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you’ve faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.</p><h2 id="Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others"><a href="#Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others" class="headerlink" title="Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?"></a>Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?</h2><p>With Dr. Fone - Virtual Location software, you will be able to share <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends.html" >a fake or any location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you want with your friends and family.

Then, launch the app and select the “Virtual Location” option from the toolkit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The next step is to set up the phone’s connection. Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  and click on the “Get Started” button. Now, detect your current virtual location by clicking on the “Current Virtual Location” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="detect actual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now go to the search box and type the location you want to switch to.

It is an excellent choice for staying updated about family when you have security concerns. Despite this, it can be intrusive when you need your privacy. If you’re a group member and wonder how to turn off Life360 without parents knowing on iPhone and Android devices, you’re in luck. This article will provide you with a complete guide on how to turn off Life 360 without anyone knowing.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Life-360"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Life-360" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Life 360?"></a>Part 1: What is Life 360?</h2><p>Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch. This tracking app makes it easy to trace the location of your loved ones or anyone you want to track. But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png"                      alt="life360 for location sharing"                ></p><p>Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png"                      alt="life360 map showing circles"                ></p><p>Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency. In addition, the app automatically contacts the emergency contacts you added when you do this. However, this doesn’t change that it can get intrusive when you need some privacy. That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.png"                      alt="sending help alert on life360"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing</h2><p>There are times when you want to turn Life360 off without it showing so that people don’t know your present location. But, if you have no idea how to go about it, you’re in luck. This section covers the best methods to stop sharing your location with friends and family on Life360.</p><h3 id="1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360"><a href="#1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360" class="headerlink" title="1.

Since there are so many location spoofing tools out there, I decided to give VPNa Fake GPS location app a try and have come up with its genuine review here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More"><a href="#Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More"></a>Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More</h2><p>Developed by XdoApp, VPNa Fake GPS is a popular application that can change the location of your Android virtually. Using it, you can spoof your device location to almost anywhere in the world. This would be reflected in almost all the installed gaming, dating, and other apps on your phone automatically.</p><ul><li>You can look for any location on the interface of VPNa Fake GPS by entering keywords (name&#x2F;address) or the exact coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the place.</li><li>To fake GPS using VPNa, you would be presented with a map-like interface and can easily move the pin around to spoof your location to an exact place.</li><li>Besides that, if there is a location that you change frequently, then you can also mark it as a favorite.</li><li>The VPNa fake GPS location APK would also maintain the record of the past locations that you have spoofed.</li><li>Using VPNa Fake GPS, you can change your location as many times as you want without paying anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/vpna/vpna-fake-gps-1.jpg"                      alt="use vpns fake gps"                ></p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><ul><li>The changed location would be reflected in almost every dating and gaming app.</li><li>The basic version of VPNa Fake GPS is available for free and doesn’t need root access.</li><li>The overall interface of VPNa Fake GPS APK is pretty user-friendly and smooth.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Cons</em></strong></p><ul><li>At times, some advanced apps (like Pokemon Go) can detect it and might get your account banned.</li><li>While using the free VPNa fake GPS version, you would get in-app ads.</li><li>Sometimes, the location is not spoofed even after consecutive attempts.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Pricing</em></strong>: While you can access the basic version of VPNa Fake GPS for free, you can pay $2.99 for an ad-free experience.</p><p><strong><em>Compatibility</em></strong>: Android 4.4 and newer versions</p><p><strong><em>Play Store Rating:</em></strong> 3.6&#x2F;5</p><p><strong><em>Important Note</em></strong></p><p>Don’t get confused by the name of VPNa Fake GPS as it is not a VPN, but only a location spoofing solution. If you are looking for a VPN app, then you should consider other options.</p><p><strong><em>Final Verdict</em></strong></p><p>Overall, VPNa Fake GPS location free is worth a try. It is pretty lightweight, easy-to-use, and supports almost all the prominent apps. Since you don’t have to pay anything to use VPNa Fake GPS, you can give it a try, and explore it on your own.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-to-Spoof-Your-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-to-Spoof-Your-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use VPNa Fake GPS Location Free to Spoof Your Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Use VPNa Fake GPS Location Free to Spoof Your Location?</h2><p>Now when you know how VPNa fake GPS Location Free works, let’s quickly understand how to use it to change the location on any Android phone.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Enable-Developer-Options-on-your-phone"><a href="#Step-1-Enable-Developer-Options-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enable Developer Options on your phone"></a><strong>Step 1: Enable Developer Options on your phone</strong></h3><p>To set up a mock location app, you need to first enable the Developer Options on your device.

Highly recommended!”</td></tr><tr><td>Brian Thompson.</td><td>“Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren’t available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you’d charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user.”</td></tr><tr><td>Gerald</td><td>“It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text.

If you want to listen to your favorite retro song, or you want to discover the latest hits, Spotify has everything. You can also listen to some really good podcasts and album hits. But what most of us don’t know is that your Spotify Location can determine what kind of content you might come across on the platform.</p><p>Your playlist suggestions depend on the country and region you are staying in. And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify</strong></h2><p>Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.</p><p><strong>Region Specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg"                      alt="region specific spotify content"                ></p><p>The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.</p><p><strong>Geo-Based Suggestions</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg"                      alt="sopify playlist"                ></p><p>Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.</p><p><strong>But is Spotify available everywhere?</strong></p><p>How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.</p><p>The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone"></a><strong>Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone</strong></h2><p>Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content. To make that possible, you can use some of the best online tools to fake spotify location whenever you want.

The process is quite simple and can be implemented in all the leading versions of Windows (and other operating systems). Though, there could be a slight change in the overall interface of the OS you are using. To set up free VPN PPT, follow these steps:</p><p>1. To start with, launch Control Panel and go to the Network and Sharing Center.</p><p>2. From here, you need to select the “Set up a new connection or network” option to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-2.png"                      alt="free pptp vpn connection"                ></p><p>3. This will launch a new wizard that can be used to setup a PPTP VPN free. Out of all the provided options, select the “Connect to a workplace” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-3.jpg"                      alt="connect to a workplace"                ></p><p>4. On the next window, you would be given an option to either dial directly or use a VPN. Click on the “Use my Internet Connection (VPN)” option to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-4.png"                      alt="Use my Internet Connection"                ></p><p>5. Great! Now, you need to provide information related to the host and server. You can refer the free PPTP VPN list we have provided in the previous section and pick the server (and hostname) of your choice.</p><p>6. As you would proceed to the next window, you need to provide the username and password of the PPTP VPN free you are using. The same can be obtained from our free PPTP VPN list.</p><p>7.

Go to the Security tab and make sure the type of VPN is listed as PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol). Also, the data encryption option should be “Optional Encryption (Connect even if no encryption)” and the option for “Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)” should be selected for “Allow these protocols”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-6.jpg"                      alt="pptp vpn properties"                ></p><p>10. Furthermore, you can go to the General tab to make sure the server is specified correctly.</p><p>11. Once it is done, you can save these changes and exit the interface. Now, go to the list of available networks and connect to the free PPTP VPN you have created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-7.png"                      alt="connect to free pptp vpn"                ></p><p>That’s it!

Fixed"></a>iSpoofer is not working On Xiaomi 14? Fixed</h2><p>Pokemon Go is one of the most appreciated games across the world. Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1"                ></p><p>However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?</p><p>You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Does-iSpoofer-Still-Work-Why"><a href="#Part-1-Does-iSpoofer-Still-Work-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?"></a><strong>Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?</strong></h2><p>If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2"                ></p><p>Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.</p><p>One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3"                ></p><p>iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.</p><p>So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4"                ></p><p>There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely"><a href="#Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?"></a><strong>Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?</strong></h2><p>If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Xiaomi 14 device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.</p><p>If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -</p><p><strong>VPNs</strong> - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5"                ></p><p><strong>Apps on App Store</strong> - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a sure shot at changing your location without any hassle, then the best suggestion would be to use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Changer.

Users can also pay for premium perks to access more safety and tracking features for the security of their loved ones.</p><p>There are many valuable features in the life360 app, such as device tracking and locator, which allows you to track your stolen or lost devices. It also allows users to track what other circle members like to do, which route they prefer, and which locations they usually visit.

It does not work when the Xiaomi 14 device is turned off, or its battery is dead.</p><p>The paid features of life360 notify circle members when you text while driving. Even if the user turns this feature off, it will still show that you are doing something on your phone while driving.</p><p>One of the best features of Life360 is the panic button which allows users to send out mass emergency texts to their circle members with their GPS coordinates if they are in danger.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-Life360-see-your-texts"><a href="#Part-3-Can-Life360-see-your-texts" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can Life360 see your texts?"></a>Part 3: Can Life360 see your texts?</h2><p>Although it uses some tracking features, there are limitations on what the app can or cannot do. If you are wondering can life360 see your texts, then the answer is “No”; the app can only see and track your texts under one condition. As Life360 links group members’ devices, it can read texts sent between members of any group. All circle members get notifications when your app is active. Some applications allow users to view the text on someone’s device, like their spouse or partner, but life360 does not compromise the privacy of its users and only shows limited information without any way of spying on others.</p><p>Now, you know that Life360 cannot see your text message, but what can Life360 see? Here are some of the typical functionalities and data that Life360 can see:</p><p><strong>1. Location:</strong> Life360 can track the real-time location of the Xiaomi 14 devices associated with the app. This includes the ability to view the current whereabouts of family members on a map and track their movements over time.</p><p><strong>2. Geofencing:</strong> The app allows you to set up geofences, which are virtual boundaries around specific areas. Life360 can detect when a family member enters or leaves a geofenced location and send notifications accordingly.</p><p><strong>3. Driving behavior:</strong> Life360 offers features to monitor driving behavior, such as detecting speed, hard braking, and rapid acceleration. It can provide insights into how safely someone is driving and notify other family members of any concerning events.</p><p><strong>4. Crash detection:</strong> Life360 also includes a crash detection feature that uses sensors in the Xiaomi 14 device to detect potential car accidents. In such cases, the app can automatically send alerts to emergency contacts.</p><p><strong>5. Check-ins and notifications:</strong> You can manually check in at specific locations to let your family members know you have arrived safely. Life360 also allows for sending notifications and messages within the app.</p><p><strong>6. Battery level:</strong> Life360 may have access to the battery level of the Xiaomi 14 devices connected to the app. This information can be used to provide alerts when a family member’s device is low on battery.</p><p>It’s important to note that while Life360 is designed to facilitate family communication and safety, the extent of data visibility and tracking can vary based on the settings and permissions configured within the app.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-stop-Life360-from-seeing-your-location-data"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-stop-Life360-from-seeing-your-location-data" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to stop Life360 from seeing your location data?"></a>Part 5: How to stop Life360 from seeing your location data?</h2><p>Life360 can only have limited access to your texts, but it tracks your location as long as the app runs in the background and the location services are on.

There are zero cons to using Life360 for its intended purpose.</p><p><strong>FAQ 2: My Wi-Fi is Off. Can people still see my location on Life360?</strong></p><p>Unless your location services are Off, your location might still be viewable on Life360 as data can be transmitted over cellular as well as Wi-Fi. So, switching Wi-Fi off will not prevent users from seeing your location on Life360.</p><p><strong>FAQ 3: How can I hide my Life360 history?</strong></p><p>There is no way to hide your Life360 history. There are only two ways to remove your Life360 history, though – deleting the Life360 account itself or removing a device from the Life360 Circle. If you are a minor trying to wriggle your way out of some trouble, removing yourself from the Circle or deleting your account is a sure-fire way of getting you into more trouble!</p><p><strong>FAQ 4: Isn’t Life360 an invasion of privacy?</strong></p><p>Life360 is designed for parents to always stay informed about the digital well-being of their children and their location. Children might think this is an invasion of privacy but given what’s out there on the internet and in the world, parents are rightfully concerned. If you are using Life360 as a rudimentary spyware to track your ex or any such purposes, then that is on you and that is an invasion of their privacy.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope reading this article helped relieve your concerns about the Life360 app. Can you track text messages with life360 “Yes” the app tracks your location through texts but can life360 read texts, or can life360 see who you text, “No” because it cannot monitor all your device’s actions. The device can see if you are texting others. Still, it cannot store any data, so you can privately communicate with people inside or outside your circle. But you can stop the app from tracking your location for safety purposes, so you have to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to trick location-based applications or change your GPS coordinates or location history with one click.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-honor-magic-5-lite-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Honor Magic 5 Lite?

It is an excellent choice for staying updated about family when you have security concerns. Despite this, it can be intrusive when you need your privacy. If you’re a group member and wonder how to turn off Life360 without parents knowing on iPhone and Android devices, you’re in luck. This article will provide you with a complete guide on how to turn off Life 360 without anyone knowing.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Life-360"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Life-360" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Life 360?"></a>Part 1: What is Life 360?</h2><p>Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch. This tracking app makes it easy to trace the location of your loved ones or anyone you want to track. But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png"                      alt="life360 for location sharing"                ></p><p>Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png"                      alt="life360 map showing circles"                ></p><p>Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency. In addition, the app automatically contacts the emergency contacts you added when you do this. However, this doesn’t change that it can get intrusive when you need some privacy. That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.png"                      alt="sending help alert on life360"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing</h2><p>There are times when you want to turn Life360 off without it showing so that people don’t know your present location. But, if you have no idea how to go about it, you’re in luck. This section covers the best methods to stop sharing your location with friends and family on Life360.</p><h3 id="1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360"><a href="#1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360"></a>1. <strong>Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360</strong></h3><p>There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.</p><ul><li>First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.</li><li>Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png"                      alt="locate the circle on life360"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on ‘location sharing’ and click on the slider next to it to disable location sharing.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.jpg"                      alt="click on location sharing"                ></p><ul><li>Now you can recheck the map, and it will show ‘location sharing paused.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-Your-Oppo-Reno-10-Pro-5G’s-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-off-Your-Oppo-Reno-10-Pro-5G’s-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn off Your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G’s Airplane Mode"></a>2. <strong>Turn off Your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G’s Airplane Mode</strong></h3><p>Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.</p><p><strong>For your iOS devices</strong>: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong> owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3.

But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png"                      alt="life360 for location sharing"                ></p><p>Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it.

Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360"></a>1. <strong>Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360</strong></h3><p>There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.</p><ul><li>First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.</li><li>Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png"                      alt="locate the circle on life360"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on ‘location sharing’ and click on the slider next to it to disable location sharing.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.jpg"                      alt="click on location sharing"                ></p><ul><li>Now you can recheck the map, and it will show ‘location sharing paused.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-Your-Vivo-Y17s’s-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-off-Your-Vivo-Y17s’s-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn off Your Vivo Y17s’s Airplane Mode"></a>2. <strong>Turn off Your Vivo Y17s’s Airplane Mode</strong></h3><p>Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.</p><p><strong>For your iOS devices</strong>: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong> owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Vivo Y17s keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set.

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Motorola Moto G23 device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store.

As mentioned, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location uses the most advanced technology to spoof your GPS location, so apps like Pokémon Go can’t find your actual GPS location.</p><p>Overall, if you are looking for the ultimate tool to spoof your GPS location, then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i

It is an excellent choice for staying updated about family when you have security concerns. Despite this, it can be intrusive when you need your privacy. If you’re a group member and wonder how to turn off Life360 without parents knowing on iPhone and Android devices, you’re in luck. This article will provide you with a complete guide on how to turn off Life 360 without anyone knowing.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Life-360"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Life-360" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Life 360?"></a>Part 1: What is Life 360?</h2><p>Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch. This tracking app makes it easy to trace the location of your loved ones or anyone you want to track. But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png"                      alt="life360 for location sharing"                ></p><p>Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png"                      alt="life360 map showing circles"                ></p><p>Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency. In addition, the app automatically contacts the emergency contacts you added when you do this. However, this doesn’t change that it can get intrusive when you need some privacy. That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.png"                      alt="sending help alert on life360"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing</h2><p>There are times when you want to turn Life360 off without it showing so that people don’t know your present location. But, if you have no idea how to go about it, you’re in luck. This section covers the best methods to stop sharing your location with friends and family on Life360.</p><h3 id="1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360"><a href="#1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360"></a>1. <strong>Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360</strong></h3><p>There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.</p><ul><li>First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.</li><li>Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png"                      alt="locate the circle on life360"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on ‘location sharing’ and click on the slider next to it to disable location sharing.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.jpg"                      alt="click on location sharing"                ></p><ul><li>Now you can recheck the map, and it will show ‘location sharing paused.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-Your-OnePlus-12’s-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-off-Your-OnePlus-12’s-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn off Your OnePlus 12’s Airplane Mode"></a>2. <strong>Turn off Your OnePlus 12’s Airplane Mode</strong></h3><p>Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.</p><p><strong>For your iOS devices</strong>: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong> owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Disable GPS Service on Your Device"></a>3. <strong>Disable GPS Service on Your Device</strong></h3><p>Another top method of turning off Life360 is disabling the GPS service on your device. It is an effective option, and you can carry it out on your iOS and Android devices.

If you want some privacy or don’t trust members of your circle, you might want to learn how to turn off Life 360. The problem with turning off the Life360 location is that members of your circle might notice, which would inevitably cause some conflict.</p><p>Fortunately, you have another effective option, and that is by faking your GPS location using a location spoofer. You can display the location you want while keeping your true location safe on Life360. Dr. Fone –Virtual location is an excellent tool for faking your location.  </p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><strong>Steps to Fake Location Using Dr. Fone – Virtual Location</strong></p><p>Below, we’ve broken down the process for you; keep reading to learn how to fake location using Dr. Fone – Virtual Location.</p><p>1.

For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr.Fone Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your OnePlus 12 (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer. You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg"                      alt="drfone-change-location-pic-7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.</p><p>As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg"                      alt="change-location-registered-pic-10"                ></p><p>It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.</p><h2 id="Can-Life360-Track-You-When-Your-OnePlus-12-is-off"><a href="#Can-Life360-Track-You-When-Your-OnePlus-12-is-off" class="headerlink" title="Can Life360 Track You When Your OnePlus 12 is off?"></a>Can Life360 Track You When Your OnePlus 12 is off?</h2><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png"                      alt="avatar"                ></a></p><p>Did you know that your OnePlus 12 tracks your location even when turned off?

Life360 is monitoring software that can be downloaded into your OnePlus 12 and used by the individuals who are part of your Family Circle to monitor your location and the location of anybody else who is part of your Family Circle.</p><p>The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="6-Ways-to-Change-Spotify-Location-On-Your-Vivo-Y200e-5G"><a href="#6-Ways-to-Change-Spotify-Location-On-Your-Vivo-Y200e-5G" class="headerlink" title="6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Vivo Y200e 5G"></a>6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Vivo Y200e 5G</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png"                      alt="change location"                ></p><p>Spotify’s booming audio business is proof that people are in love with its services. If you want to listen to your favorite retro song, or you want to discover the latest hits, Spotify has everything. You can also listen to some really good podcasts and album hits. But what most of us don’t know is that your Spotify Location can determine what kind of content you might come across on the platform.</p><p>Your playlist suggestions depend on the country and region you are staying in. And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify</strong></h2><p>Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.</p><p><strong>Region Specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg"                      alt="region specific spotify content"                ></p><p>The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.</p><p><strong>Geo-Based Suggestions</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg"                      alt="sopify playlist"                ></p><p>Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.</p><p><strong>But is Spotify available everywhere?</strong></p><p>How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.</p><p>The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone"></a><strong>Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone</strong></h2><p>Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content. To make that possible, you can use some of the best online tools to fake spotify location whenever you want. Instead of going for the regular Spotify Update Location, you can use these third-party applications to change the location on your iPhone devices (will reflect in Spotify too).</p><p>The Wondershare’s Dr. Fone is a very good application that lets you change location Spotify with a few easy steps.

Not only on Spotify, your other social media apps and location using apps will also record the new virtual location.</p><p><strong>Cydia - Location Faker App</strong></p><p>For the Spotify Change Region, Cydia’s Location Faker App is the perfect choice for iPhones. The software is also available in different versions to choose for your device model. You won’t need a computer for this and everything happens over your iPhone only.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Locationfaker version suitable for your phone. Locationfaker8 is available for the 8.0 version of iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-locationfaker-version-app-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download locationfaker"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will notice a map appear on the screen. You can either move your pin-point to the new location or enter the address or coordinates into the search box on top of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/toggle-off-and-on-pic10.jpg"                      alt="map toggle off and on"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you settle with the coordinates, shift the ‘Off’ toggle to ‘On’. It is present at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-and-permit-apps-pic11.jpg"                      alt="change off toggle to on"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On the bottom of the page, in the same line as the toggle, you will find the ‘i’ icon. Click on that and several options will open. From there, choose ‘White List’. All the apps that need access to your new location will display. Search for Spotify and enable it.</p><p><strong>Cydia - Location Handle App</strong></p><p>To change spotify region, the Location Hanle App from Cydia might bring in more benefits than the usual location spoofing options.

However, for Spotify update Location, it still does a great job.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You can download the Location Handle application either from their website or the app store.

It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg"                      alt="snap map feature"                ></p><p>This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.</p><p>This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?"></a><strong>Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?</strong></h2><p>The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?</p><p>Yes, Absolutely!</p><p>There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.</p><p><strong>Ghost Mode:</strong> The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg"                      alt="track camera screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg"                      alt="find bitmoji"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location setting on snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg"                      alt="duration ghost mode"                ></p><p>If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.</p><p><strong>Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone</strong></p><p>If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg"                      alt="check location notification tray"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on&#x2F;off.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg" alt="tap location on/off"></p><p><strong>iPhone</strong></p><p>To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg"                      alt="go to setting on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg"                      alt="tap privacy option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg"                      alt="click location services option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg"                      alt="turn off location service"                ></p><p>These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location. You must be knowing how to send location on snapchat through chats - even this won’t be possible once you completely turn off the GPS of your devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat</strong></h2><p>If you are wondering how to fake location on snapchat, then the Snapchat location spoofer is one of the best options.

Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.</p><p><strong>Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?</strong></p><p>A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Conclusion"></a><strong>Part 4: Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success.

If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country.

This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.</p><p><strong>Geo-Based Suggestions</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg"                      alt="sopify playlist"                ></p><p>Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you.

However, Spotify is not available in all the countries.

It is an excellent choice for staying updated about family when you have security concerns. Despite this, it can be intrusive when you need your privacy. If you’re a group member and wonder how to turn off Life360 without parents knowing on iPhone and Android devices, you’re in luck. This article will provide you with a complete guide on how to turn off Life 360 without anyone knowing.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Life-360"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Life-360" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Life 360?"></a>Part 1: What is Life 360?</h2><p>Many applications are available today to help family and friends track each other for various purposes. One such app is Life360, and it has been successful since its launch. This tracking app makes it easy to trace the location of your loved ones or anyone you want to track. But, first, you need to create a circle of friends on a map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png"                      alt="life360 for location sharing"                ></p><p>Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png"                      alt="life360 map showing circles"                ></p><p>Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency. In addition, the app automatically contacts the emergency contacts you added when you do this. However, this doesn’t change that it can get intrusive when you need some privacy. That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.png"                      alt="sending help alert on life360"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing</h2><p>There are times when you want to turn Life360 off without it showing so that people don’t know your present location. But, if you have no idea how to go about it, you’re in luck. This section covers the best methods to stop sharing your location with friends and family on Life360.</p><h3 id="1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360"><a href="#1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360"></a>1. <strong>Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360</strong></h3><p>There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.</p><ul><li>First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.</li><li>Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png"                      alt="locate the circle on life360"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on ‘location sharing’ and click on the slider next to it to disable location sharing.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.jpg"                      alt="click on location sharing"                ></p><ul><li>Now you can recheck the map, and it will show ‘location sharing paused.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-Your-Xiaomi-13T’s-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-off-Your-Xiaomi-13T’s-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn off Your Xiaomi 13T’s Airplane Mode"></a>2. <strong>Turn off Your Xiaomi 13T’s Airplane Mode</strong></h3><p>Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.</p><p><strong>For your iOS devices</strong>: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong> owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Disable GPS Service on Your Device"></a>3. <strong>Disable GPS Service on Your Device</strong></h3><p>Another top method of turning off Life360 is disabling the GPS service on your device. It is an effective option, and you can carry it out on your iOS and Android devices.

If you want some privacy or don’t trust members of your circle, you might want to learn how to turn off Life 360. The problem with turning off the Life360 location is that members of your circle might notice, which would inevitably cause some conflict.</p><p>Fortunately, you have another effective option, and that is by faking your GPS location using a location spoofer. You can display the location you want while keeping your true location safe on Life360. Dr. Fone –Virtual location is an excellent tool for faking your location.  </p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><strong>Steps to Fake Location Using Dr. Fone – Virtual Location</strong></p><p>Below, we’ve broken down the process for you; keep reading to learn how to fake location using Dr. Fone – Virtual Location.</p><p>1.

This is what geo-blocking means. If you want to know more about geo-blocking, you have come to the right article. This article provides the definition, symbols, function, type, and how to bypass a geo-blocked site.</p><p>Encryption is often used in geo-blocking as a means of protecting material that is restricted to users in just certain locations. In its long existence, the method has been met with several obstacles. These obstacles will be discussed in the next sections!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/what-is-geo-blocking-and-how-to-bypass-it-academy.jpg"                      alt="what is geo blocking"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

It will also show how websites inform viewers that they are in geo-blocking areas.</p><h3 id="Definition-of-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Definition-of-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Definition of Geo-Blocking"></a>Definition of Geo-Blocking</h3><p>Geo-blocking is the practice of restricting online access to certain users depending on where in the world they happen to be physically located. Telecommunications firms, websites, and other content providers and intellectual property owners often use this method for copyright protection. To monitor and enforce geo-blocks, databases that map out IP addresses’ geographical locations are often employed.</p><h3 id="Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements"><a href="#Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements"></a>Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements</h3><p>You sometimes can’t access a site because it isn’t available in your area. This is the main element carried by geo-blocking.</p><p>Every online-surfing tool has a unique identifier called “IP address”. The address can identify the Xiaomi 13T devices’ geographical location. When users access a website, their devices send their IP addresses to the online servers. The servers read if the IP addresses are included in the allowed list and determine whether to allow the visitors to view the content.</p><p>The visitors usually know they are geographically limited through the website’s displayed outcomes, a poster indicating that the service is unavailable in the location. Take the geo-banned access by Airbnb as an example below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/service-unavailable-in-location.jpg"                      alt="geo blocked airbnb"                ></p><p>Although Airbnb has been criticized for posing a threat to the availability of low-cost lodging in metropolitan areas, it has proven to be a useful resource for travelers. However, not everyone can use it; for instance, it is unavailable in Iran due to US sanctions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Geo-Blocking-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Geo-Blocking-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?</h2><p>When a firm, rather than a government, is responsible for geoblocking, IP addresses are often the first line of defense. Your IP address is like a street address, revealing where you live.</p><p>IP addresses are numerical identifiers that distinguish each machine on the internet. Your computer’s IP address is sent to the server of the website you visit so that it may supply the required data.</p><p>You’ll be assigned an IP address when you sign up for an Internet Service Provider. It is possible to pinpoint the location of your device using its IP address, albeit the degree of precision may vary. Websites use the IP address to determine whether you can read their content. They will thus refuse your request if you are using an IP address that’s not on their approved list.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Common Types of Geo-blocked Content"></a>Part 3. Common Types of Geo-blocked Content</h2><p>The difficulty stems from legal hurdles, including copyrights, licenses, and territorial disputes. Certain streaming services may not make all of their offerings accessible in all regions, or a major online shop may restrict some of their offerings to customers in just one geographic area.</p><h3 id="Youtube"><a href="#Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Youtube"></a>Youtube</h3><p>Users who upload videos can restrict access to them in certain countries. This nearly usually indicates that a business has chosen that you shouldn’t be able to see a video because of where you are located.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/youtube-blocked-assets-video-not-available.jpg"                      alt="geo blocked video on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Spotify"><a href="#Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Spotify"></a>Spotify</h3><p>You may be trying to find a method to unblock Spotify because you want to listen to unavailable music in your country or because the app has been prohibited in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/spotify-not-available-blocked-geoblock.jpg"                      alt="spotify geo blocked"                ></p><h3 id="Live-Sports"><a href="#Live-Sports" class="headerlink" title="Live Sports"></a>Live Sports</h3><p>Big events may be aired exclusively by one company, which means you may be forced to pay to access certain material or go through annoying subscription hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/fox-sport-geo-blocking-page.jpg"                      alt="fox sports geo blocked"                ></p><h3 id="Pandora"><a href="#Pandora" class="headerlink" title="Pandora"></a>Pandora</h3><p>Do you want to tune in to this online radio and music station?

Tips to Bypass Geo-Blocking"></a>Part 4. Tips to Bypass Geo-Blocking</h2><p>While certain sites may be blocked in your country, there are still methods to access the full functionality of the web. What exactly are they, and how do you go about getting them? Here’s more reading material.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-Smart-Domain-Name-System-DNS"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Smart-Domain-Name-System-DNS" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Use Smart Domain Name System (DNS)"></a>Method 1. Use Smart Domain Name System (DNS)</h3><p>Clever DNS can evade geoblocking if your smart TV, streaming box, or gaming console doesn’t support VPNs or proxy servers. Some home routers can generate VPN connections, but not all.</p><p>By changing your DNS address, clever DNS may alter your device’s virtual location. Smart DNS replaces your Internet provider’s DNS server. Netflix.com’s IP is not netflix.com. You’ll acquire the smart DNS provider’s transparent DNS proxy IP. Netflix thinks you’re in the US since this proxy server is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/smart-dns-proxy-working.jpg"                      alt="using smart dns for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Connect-to-Proxy-Servers"><a href="#Method-2-Connect-to-Proxy-Servers" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Connect to Proxy Servers"></a>Method 2. Connect to Proxy Servers</h3><p>Rather than connecting you directly to the server housing the material you want, a proxy server functions as an intermediary. A proxy server does what its name implies: it acts on your behalf to get access to the data and then forwards it to you. Proxy servers, especially those in foreign countries, may be used to get around geographical restrictions.</p><p>Depending on the kind of proxy server you use, you may or may not be able to conceal your IP address when surfing the web. Proxy servers are available online and may be accessed from any web browser. Setting up a proxy server is easy, but your activity may still be vulnerable since proxies don’t secure your data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/proxy-caching-illustration.jpg"                      alt="proxy servers for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-the-Tor-Browser"><a href="#Method-3-Use-the-Tor-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use the Tor Browser"></a>Method 3. Use the Tor Browser</h3><p>In addition to using a VPN, you may use the anonymous Tor browser. The Tor browser links to the Tor network, a collection of computers that collaborate to conceal your online footprint by relaying your traffic via several intermediary nodes.</p><p>Tor employs a technique called “onion routing” to conceal its users’ identities. Since more time is required to traverse these additional levels, your internet speed may suffer as a consequence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/use-tor-browser-to-bypass-geo-blocking.jpg"                      alt="tor for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection"><a href="#Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. A Good VPN Connection"></a>Method 4. A Good VPN Connection</h3><p>A virtual private network (VPN) may hide your online identity and protect your data by encrypting your connection. VPNs allow you to get around geographically restricted material by redirecting your connection via a server in another country. This will allow you to connect to VPN servers in other countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, or Australia.</p><p>With <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/pokemon-go/spoof-pokemon-go-location-with-vpn.html" >effective VPN tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can surf the web anonymously, unblock geo-blocked content, and watch your favorite programs abroad.

FAQs About Geo-Blocking"></a>Part 5. FAQs About Geo-Blocking</h2><p>Here are the answers to four questions that you might ask about geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="1-Is-Geo-Blocking-Legal"><a href="#1-Is-Geo-Blocking-Legal" class="headerlink" title="1. Is Geo-Blocking Legal?"></a>1. Is Geo-Blocking Legal?</h3><p>Yes. It’s legitimate. Limiting access to websites and services based on a user’s location is lawful. This practice is routinely used in nations like China to prevent citizens from seeing politically sensitive material. Legal arrangements, such as licensing agreements, may also be enforced by geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal"><a href="#2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal" class="headerlink" title="2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?"></a>2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?</h3><p>It depends. Depending on the situation, the nation, the purpose of the use, and the technique used, geo-blocking circumvention may be against the law. Copyright regulations prohibit users from accessing material beyond its designated location, yet many providers are reluctant to penalize users for doing so.</p><h3 id="3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?"></a>3. What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>Geo-fencing is to create digital fences on which to base real-world judgments about where to go. One may draw a boundary around it using longitude and latitude lines on a map to easily establish who is permitted inside a certain region. Restricting access to material based on a user’s physical location is called “geo-blocking.”</p><h3 id="4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?"></a>4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>They are the same. Restricting a user’s ability to access certain online resources depending on their location is known as geo-blocking or geo-restriction. To safeguard their license agreements, foreign media streaming firms often use the practice of geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>For several reasons, media and content producers use geo-blocking. Although geo-blocking is unlikely to ever go out of style, there are techniques to circumvent it. Use a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass geo-restrictions on the material you want to watch. Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), a proxy server, the Tor network, etc., your online location may be hidden or masked.</p><p>Geo-blocking controls. It’s both useful and abused. Website banning discriminates and manipulates. Geography may be annoying and frustrating. Sadly, they may always be in style. You don’t have to tolerate them!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-on-oppo-reno-10-5g-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 Methods to Turn off Life 360 On Oppo Reno 10 5G without Anyone Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-best-route-generator-apps-you-should-try-on-motorola-moto-g-5g-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/a-detailed-vpna-fake-gps-location-free-review-on-itel-p40plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Itel P40+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-nokia-c12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Nokia C12 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/a-detailed-guide-on-faking-your-location-in-mozilla-firefox-on-samsung-galaxy-a05-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On Samsung Galaxy A05 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/11-best-location-changers-for-vivo-y55s-5g-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>11 Best Location Changers for Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-on-vivo-s17e-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 Methods to Turn off Life 360 On Vivo S17e without Anyone Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/a-detailed-guide-on-faking-your-location-in-mozilla-firefox-on-honor-x9a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On Honor X9a | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-xiaomi-redmi-a2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Xiaomi Redmi A2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-vivo-s17e-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Vivo S17e | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-sony-xperia-10-v-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Sony Xperia 10 V?

This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Vivo V27 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Vivo V27 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Vivo V27 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Vivo V27 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Vivo V27 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Vivo V27 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Vivo V27 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Vivo-V27-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Vivo-V27-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Vivo V27  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Vivo V27  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Vivo V27  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Vivo-V27-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Vivo-V27-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Vivo V27  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Vivo V27  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem.

Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature.

Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Vivo-V27-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Vivo-V27-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Vivo V27  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Vivo V27  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone.

Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick.

Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it.
