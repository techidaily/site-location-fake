It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Realme V30 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Realme V30 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Realme V30 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Realme V30 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Realme V30 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Realme V30 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Realme V30 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Realme-V30-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Realme-V30-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Realme V30  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Realme V30  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Realme V30  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Realme-V30-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Realme-V30-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Realme V30  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Realme V30  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134494/18498" target="_top" id="2134494">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134494" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134494/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087409/7443" target="_top" id="2087409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087409/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Realme V30  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Realme V30  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Realme-V30-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Realme-V30-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Realme V30  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Realme V30  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Realme V30  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Realme V30  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Realme V30  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart Realme V30](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Realme" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Realme <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> V30 .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Realme V30 device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Realme V30 device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends"></a>Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends</h3><p>Another tip that can help you resolve to <strong>Find My Friends location not available</strong> is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn’t logged into the feature, you won’t access his&#x2F;her location.</p><p>Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again"><a href="#Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again"></a>Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again</h3><p>Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you’ve faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.</p><h2 id="Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others"><a href="#Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others" class="headerlink" title="Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?"></a>Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?</h2><p>With Dr. Fone - Virtual Location software, you will be able to share <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends.html" >a fake or any location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you want with your friends and family.

But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2"                ></p><p>Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.</p><p>One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3"                ></p><p>iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.</p><p>So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4"                ></p><p>There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398449/3022" target="_top" id="398449">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398449" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398449/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely"><a href="#Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?"></a><strong>Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?</strong></h2><p>If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Realme V30 device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.</p><p>If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -</p><p><strong>VPNs</strong> - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5"                ></p><p><strong>Apps on App Store</strong> - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a sure shot at changing your location without any hassle, then the best suggestion would be to use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Changer.

Thanks to its easy-to-use features and excellent app, with Life360, your life will be as secure and private as possible.</p><p>Whether you’re looking to sync photos, videos, contacts, messages, and locations with your mobile devices and computers or simply set up your home cameras to automatically send you alerts, Life360 is designed to be the most powerful mobile phone service provider you’ve ever seen.</p><p>It’s the most secure and easiest-to-use service, but it’s not the cheapest. So, let’s know what Life360 is and how Life360 work.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Life360"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Life360?"></a>Part 1: What Is Life360?</h2><p>A smartphone software called Life360 tracking system enables families to communicate, track their whereabouts, and get alerts about their loved one’s safety and well-being.</p><p>When Life360 is installed on the phone, the administrator may create geo-fences specifying certain locations. For example, geo-fences might be employed to monitor family members’ arrival and departure times. In addition to that, the program provides driving analysis by means of the Life360 Driver Protect module.</p><p>Additionally, BMW has incorporated Life360 into its onboard location tracking. Accident identification and rescue operations are provided through an app that tracks authorized drivers and offers monitoring and analysis.</p><p>Both parties need to have the app installed for one to be able to monitor the activities of the other. Using the app, you can see where your phone is at any given moment. A member of your family might know exactly where you are at any given time if they have the app on their phone.</p><p>Whether you are currently using the app or not, the Life360 app tracker will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of your mobile device. In addition, you may obtain real-time location information on each other, view it on a hidden map, and even choose to get automatic notifications anytime someone enters or departs a spot, according to the Life 360 website.</p><p>Every time a family member departs or comes someplace, an alert is sent to the rest of the family. You can share your location with an adult, and they can see how fast you were driving, how long it took you to come home, and who was home or at school while you were gone.</p><p>In addition, adults and children may obtain real-time instructions from a particular family member. For example, you may touch an icon of a family member to receive instructions to that user’s location on the Life360 website.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-Life360-Always-Accurate"><a href="#Part-3-Is-Life360-Always-Accurate" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?"></a>Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?</h2><p>Previously, Life360 was criticized for being inaccurate, especially when locating people. However, the company has recently updated its system to ensure that the data it collects is accurate.</p><p>The Life360 app uses GPS technology to track your location. When you first install the app, you will be prompted to set up your location. This is done by entering your zip code, city, and state.</p><p>You will also be asked to select a default location. This will be used to determine your home address. Once you enter your zip code, city, and state, you will be able to view your location on a map.</p><p>Also, Life360 works best in urban areas. If you live in an area with many tall buildings, Life360 may not work as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Is-Life360-Safe-for-Your-Privacy"><a href="#Part-4-Is-Life360-Safe-for-Your-Privacy" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?"></a>Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?</h2><p>Life360 is a relatively new app, but it has been getting attention lately. People are wondering whether it is safe for them to use and whether or not it is worth it.</p><p>According to the Life360 website, the app is safe because it is encrypted. The encryption ensures that no one can intercept your communications.</p><p>If you are worried about privacy, you can disable the app’s location tracking feature. You can also disable the feature if you want to be notified whenever someone enters or leaves a particular area.</p><p>You can also use the app without giving anyone else access to your location. You can create a guest profile.</p><p>There are no ads or in-app purchases. You do not have to give any information to Life360. You can use the app without giving any information.</p><p>Life360 is also very easy to use. You do not need to have any special training to use the app. You simply need to sign up and download the app.</p><p>Life360 is available for free on Google Play and Apple App Store.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014850/22899" target="_top" id="2014850">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014850" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014850/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Can-a-Location-be-faked-on-Life360"><a href="#Part-5-Can-a-Location-be-faked-on-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Can a Location be faked on Life360?"></a>Part 5: Can a Location be faked on Life360?</h2><p>What if You do not want your location to be tracked by someone else?

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus Nord N30 SE ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device, while “Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Nord-N30-SE-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Nord-N30-SE-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Nord N30 SE  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Nord N30 SE  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus Nord N30 SE  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896541/19272" target="_top" id="1896541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896541/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-Nord-N30-SE-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-Nord-N30-SE-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Nord N30 SE  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Nord N30 SE  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134492/18498" target="_top" id="2134492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134492/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the OnePlus Nord N30 SE  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For OnePlus Nord N30 SE  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-OnePlus-Nord-N30-SE-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-OnePlus-Nord-N30-SE-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Nord N30 SE  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Nord N30 SE  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for OnePlus Nord N30 SE  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other OnePlus Nord N30 SE  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For OnePlus Nord N30 SE  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart OnePlus Nord N30 SE](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-OnePlus" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-OnePlus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Nord N30 SE .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends"></a>Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends</h3><p>Another tip that can help you resolve to <strong>Find My Friends location not available</strong> is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn’t logged into the feature, you won’t access his&#x2F;her location.</p><p>Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again"><a href="#Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again"></a>Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again</h3><p>Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you’ve faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others"><a href="#Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others" class="headerlink" title="Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?"></a>Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?</h2><p>With Dr. Fone - Virtual Location software, you will be able to share <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends.html" >a fake or any location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you want with your friends and family.

This has to do with its innovative algorithms and thanks to its user-friendly approach. The process of faking the location involves the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Access Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and Move to Toolbox</strong></p><p>Begin with the launch of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location on your computer and establish a connection with your Android or iOS device. Navigate to the map screen and select the “Teleport Mode” icon, which is situated as the first option in the toolbar near the top-right corner. Now, start the process by tapping the search bar at the top left corner, inputting your desired location, and hitting “Enter.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="select the desired location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Move to the Targeted Location and Verify It</strong></p><p>Upon completion of the initial setup, proceed to teleport to the targeted location by clicking “Move Here” on the map screen. This action prompts the cursor to relocate to the specified location on the map. It also simultaneously adjusts the location of your Android or iOS device. To validate the successful location change, access your smartphone and open a map application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="click the move here button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem"><a href="#Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?"></a>Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?</h2><p>Faking your GPS has its advantages, primarily protecting your privacy.</p><p>However, if you’re on the receiving end of a fake GPS signal, you need to detect any spoofing attempts before it’s too late. You need to have a security measure to ensure data you’re receiving is coming from a legitimate source instead of a malicious one. It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.</p><p>Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.</p><p><strong>Food Delivery</strong></p><p>Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to. They may also gain an unfair advantage to gain priority in order queues and report longer rides to earn more from the platform. In addition, a more egregious issue is couriers charging for deliveries that weren’t made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-03.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing on food delivery driver apps"                ></p><p><strong>Gaming</strong></p><p>Using GPS spoofing in MMORPGs enables gamers to take advantage of faking their position without moving into the comforts of their own home. This can lead to more in-game rewards that are otherwise difficult to achieve without GPS spoofing.</p><p>Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.</p><p><strong>Social Media</strong></p><p>Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.</p><p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p><p>Most financial institutions across the globe use location data to verify users to prevent fraud. Having inaccurate data is a major security beach, especially when handling financial service apps on the internet.</p><p>There are various ways to protect yourself from being on the other end of a fake GPS location. You can easily use specialized apps, including <a class="link"   href="https://apkpure.com/mock-location-root-detector/com.check.mock" >mock location detection APKs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you’re on Android. These anti-spoofing GPS apps help detect if someone is providing fake GPS locations.

You can easily detect mock locations on Android, but the methods available if you’re on a different device will vary depending on the resources at your disposal.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Faking your GPS is easy nowadays.

Since there are so many location spoofing tools out there, I decided to give VPNa Fake GPS location app a try and have come up with its genuine review here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More"><a href="#Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More"></a>Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More</h2><p>Developed by XdoApp, VPNa Fake GPS is a popular application that can change the location of your Android virtually.

It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.</p><p>The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you’re interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg"                      alt="change region without vpn netflix"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006914/19272" target="_top" id="2006914">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006914" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006914/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions"></a>Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions</h2><p>Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.</p><p>Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix’s Terms of Use. If you’re caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account. This is why you should always take caution when navigating the streaming giant’s Terms of Use.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Will-Netflix-Ban-My-Account-If-I-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#Part-2-Will-Netflix-Ban-My-Account-If-I-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?"></a>Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?</h2><p>If you’re wondering if Netflix bans accounts that use VPN, the answer is “No, they don’t”. On the other hand, Netflix will block access to content if it detects that you’re connected to VPN. If this happens, simply turn off your VPN or try connecting to different servers on your VPN and retry.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148619/17108" target="_top" id="2148619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2148619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="100" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148619/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Can-You-Change-Your-Netflix-Region-Without-a-VPN"><a href="#Part-3-Can-You-Change-Your-Netflix-Region-Without-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?"></a>Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?</h2><p>There are multiple ways to change your location on Netflix without a VPN, whether you’re on your computer, iPhone, or Android.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Realme 12 Pro 5G ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Realme 12 Pro 5G device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Realme 12 Pro 5G device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Realme 12 Pro 5G device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Realme 12 Pro 5G device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Realme 12 Pro 5G device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Realme 12 Pro 5G device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Realme-12-Pro-5G-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Realme-12-Pro-5G-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Realme 12 Pro 5G  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Realme 12 Pro 5G  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Realme 12 Pro 5G  and Android phones.

Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Realme-12-Pro-5G-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Realme-12-Pro-5G-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Realme 12 Pro 5G  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Realme 12 Pro 5G  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem.

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Tecno Spark 10 5G device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144285/7443" target="_top" id="2144285">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144285" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144285/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135416/19272" target="_top" id="2135416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135416/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy. Using the “Privacy Levels” option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg"                      alt="set the privacy levels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using its “Fixed Location” feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the “Marker” on it to change your browser’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg"                      alt="set the fixed location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones"></a>Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones</h2><p>It is not only on computers where you can use Firefox fake location but also on smartphones. You can easily disable or change your Firefox location on your iOS or Android device. Three different methods to disable or change the location in Mozilla Firefox are summarized below:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-Sharing-on-the-Firefox-Browser"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-Sharing-on-the-Firefox-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation Sharing on the Firefox Browser"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation Sharing on the Firefox Browser</h3><p>If you use the Firefox browser on your phone, it allows you to disable your location using a couple of simple steps. Disabling location services for the Firefox browser differs on Android and iOS devices. A detailed step-by-step process for disabling location is given below for both platforms:</p><p><strong>On Android</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Firefox browser on your phone and press the “Three Dots” icon from the bottom right corner. Select “Settings” from the menu and navigate to the “Privacy and Security” section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-11.jpg"                      alt="access the firefox settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, tap “Site Permissions” and select “Location.” In the “Location” option, select “Blocked” to disable the location access on the Firefox browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-12.jpg"                      alt="enable the blocked option"                ></p><p><strong>On iPhone</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your iPhone, open “Settings” and scroll down to “Firefox.” After locating the app, select it and press “Location” on the next screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-13.jpg"                      alt="choose the firefox app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In the “Location” menu, you can select “Never” to completely disable the location access for the Firefox browser. To only stop Firefox from detecting your accurate location, turn off the toggle of the “Precise Location” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-14.jpg"                      alt="disable the firefox ios location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Spoof-Your-Location-in-Firefox-Using-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Spoof-Your-Location-in-Firefox-Using-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Spoof Your Location in Firefox Using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Method 2: Spoof Your Location in Firefox Using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>Nowadays, many websites work with the help of location-based services.

Turn off Your Tecno Spark 10 5G’s Airplane Mode"></a>2. <strong>Turn off Your Tecno Spark 10 5G’s Airplane Mode</strong></h3><p>Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.</p><p><strong>For your iOS devices</strong>: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong> owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134237/18498" target="_top" id="2134237">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134237" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134237/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Poco X5 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not!

It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.</p><p>The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you’re interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg"                      alt="change region without vpn netflix"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions"></a>Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions</h2><p>Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.</p><p>Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix’s Terms of Use. If you’re caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account. This is why you should always take caution when navigating the streaming giant’s Terms of Use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135367/19272" target="_top" id="2135367">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135367" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135367/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Will-Netflix-Ban-My-Account-If-I-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#Part-2-Will-Netflix-Ban-My-Account-If-I-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?"></a>Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?</h2><p>If you’re wondering if Netflix bans accounts that use VPN, the answer is “No, they don’t”. On the other hand, Netflix will block access to content if it detects that you’re connected to VPN. If this happens, simply turn off your VPN or try connecting to different servers on your VPN and retry.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-You-Change-Your-Netflix-Region-Without-a-VPN"><a href="#Part-3-Can-You-Change-Your-Netflix-Region-Without-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?"></a>Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?</h2><p>There are multiple ways to change your location on Netflix without a VPN, whether you’re on your computer, iPhone, or Android.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Lava Yuva 3 Pro ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Lava-Yuva-3-Pro-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Lava-Yuva-3-Pro-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Lava Yuva 3 Pro  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Lava Yuva 3 Pro  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Lava Yuva 3 Pro  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880940/19272" target="_top" id="1880940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880940/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Lava-Yuva-3-Pro-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Lava-Yuva-3-Pro-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Lava Yuva 3 Pro  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Lava Yuva 3 Pro  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Lava Yuva 3 Pro  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Lava Yuva 3 Pro  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Lava-Yuva-3-Pro-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Lava-Yuva-3-Pro-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Lava Yuva 3 Pro  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Lava Yuva 3 Pro  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Lava Yuva 3 Pro  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Lava Yuva 3 Pro  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Lava Yuva 3 Pro  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart Lava Yuva 3 Pro](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Lava" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Lava <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Yuva 3 Pro .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends"></a>Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends</h3><p>Another tip that can help you resolve to <strong>Find My Friends location not available</strong> is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn’t logged into the feature, you won’t access his&#x2F;her location.</p><p>Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again"><a href="#Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again"></a>Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again</h3><p>Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you’ve faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975503">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975503.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975503">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975503.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975503%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975503/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others"><a href="#Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others" class="headerlink" title="Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?"></a>Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?</h2><p>With Dr. Fone - Virtual Location software, you will be able to share <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends.html" >a fake or any location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you want with your friends and family.

Most of us are already used to organizing such activities because we’ve been doing that for a long time now. However, we cannot deny that it’s much easier nowadays than years ago. Why so? Simply because the communication channels available today at our disposal are more digital and more capable. For instance, Facebook Messenger now allows users to share their whereabouts in a snap of a finger. Yes. That feature is called Live Location.</p><p>The Live Location feature on Messenger works beyond sending the address or coordinates of your exact location.

Is that helpful? Absolutely yes. It’s indeed a game-changer in today’s already convenient world. Is it highly recommended? With proper handling and adequate caution, Messenger’s Live Location can definitely do more good than harm to the users.</p><p>In this article, we will delve into the highlights and benefits of Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing features. We will also provide some tutorials on <strong>how to share Live Location</strong> on Messenger.

Everything You Should Know About Messenger’s Live Location</h2><p>Facebook is well aware that sharing location details is essential to its users. That’s why developers have come up with a brilliant idea and rolled out Live Location on Messenger. It basically works like other location-sharing features. However, Live Location provides more precise and thorough location information. It’s in map form, where you can view the exact location and track the movements of the sender. You’ll continue to see updates for as long as the sharing is not halted on the other end. To navigate it properly, try to read tutorials on how to share Live Location on Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-1.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger live location"                ></p><p>What if you wish to send a particular address from another location? There is no problem with that. Messenger allows users to search for a specific place, trace it on the map, and share the details. The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? It’s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.</p><p>Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information. Since the details are automatically generated through GPS, you can be sure that it is correct and definite. If you go out and track it down the neighborhood, you can certainly find the location in no time. Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while you’re out and keep yourself safe from any harm.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Lava Yuva 2 Pro ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Lava Yuva 2 Pro  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Lava Yuva 2 Pro  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Lava Yuva 2 Pro  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Lava Yuva 2 Pro  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Lava Yuva 2 Pro  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Lava Yuva 2 Pro  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Lava Yuva 2 Pro  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Lava Yuva 2 Pro  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Lava Yuva 2 Pro  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Lava Yuva 2 Pro  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Lava Yuva 2 Pro  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart Lava Yuva 2 Pro](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Lava" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Lava <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Yuva 2 Pro .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends"></a>Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends</h3><p>Another tip that can help you resolve to <strong>Find My Friends location not available</strong> is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn’t logged into the feature, you won’t access his&#x2F;her location.</p><p>Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again"><a href="#Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again"></a>Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again</h3><p>Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you’ve faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.</p><h2 id="Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others"><a href="#Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others" class="headerlink" title="Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?"></a>Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?</h2><p>With Dr. Fone - Virtual Location software, you will be able to share <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends.html" >a fake or any location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you want with your friends and family.

Navigate to the map screen and select the “Teleport Mode” icon, which is situated as the first option in the toolbar near the top-right corner. Now, start the process by tapping the search bar at the top left corner, inputting your desired location, and hitting “Enter.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="select the desired location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Move to the Targeted Location and Verify It</strong></p><p>Upon completion of the initial setup, proceed to teleport to the targeted location by clicking “Move Here” on the map screen.

To validate the successful location change, access your smartphone and open a map application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="click the move here button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006941/19272" target="_top" id="2006941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem"><a href="#Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?"></a>Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?</h2><p>Faking your GPS has its advantages, primarily protecting your privacy.</p><p>However, if you’re on the receiving end of a fake GPS signal, you need to detect any spoofing attempts before it’s too late. You need to have a security measure to ensure data you’re receiving is coming from a legitimate source instead of a malicious one. It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.</p><p>Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.</p><p><strong>Food Delivery</strong></p><p>Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to. They may also gain an unfair advantage to gain priority in order queues and report longer rides to earn more from the platform. In addition, a more egregious issue is couriers charging for deliveries that weren’t made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-03.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing on food delivery driver apps"                ></p><p><strong>Gaming</strong></p><p>Using GPS spoofing in MMORPGs enables gamers to take advantage of faking their position without moving into the comforts of their own home. This can lead to more in-game rewards that are otherwise difficult to achieve without GPS spoofing.</p><p>Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.</p><p><strong>Social Media</strong></p><p>Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.</p><p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p><p>Most financial institutions across the globe use location data to verify users to prevent fraud. Having inaccurate data is a major security beach, especially when handling financial service apps on the internet.</p><p>There are various ways to protect yourself from being on the other end of a fake GPS location. You can easily use specialized apps, including <a class="link"   href="https://apkpure.com/mock-location-root-detector/com.check.mock" >mock location detection APKs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you’re on Android.

Telecommunications firms, websites, and other content providers and intellectual property owners often use this method for copyright protection. To monitor and enforce geo-blocks, databases that map out IP addresses’ geographical locations are often employed.</p><h3 id="Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements"><a href="#Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements"></a>Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements</h3><p>You sometimes can’t access a site because it isn’t available in your area. This is the main element carried by geo-blocking.</p><p>Every online-surfing tool has a unique identifier called “IP address”. The address can identify the Lava Yuva 2 Pro devices’ geographical location. When users access a website, their devices send their IP addresses to the online servers. The servers read if the IP addresses are included in the allowed list and determine whether to allow the visitors to view the content.</p><p>The visitors usually know they are geographically limited through the website’s displayed outcomes, a poster indicating that the service is unavailable in the location. Take the geo-banned access by Airbnb as an example below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/service-unavailable-in-location.jpg"                      alt="geo blocked airbnb"                ></p><p>Although Airbnb has been criticized for posing a threat to the availability of low-cost lodging in metropolitan areas, it has proven to be a useful resource for travelers.

How Does Geo-Blocking Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?</h2><p>When a firm, rather than a government, is responsible for geoblocking, IP addresses are often the first line of defense. Your IP address is like a street address, revealing where you live.</p><p>IP addresses are numerical identifiers that distinguish each machine on the internet. Your computer’s IP address is sent to the server of the website you visit so that it may supply the required data.</p><p>You’ll be assigned an IP address when you sign up for an Internet Service Provider. It is possible to pinpoint the location of your device using its IP address, albeit the degree of precision may vary. Websites use the IP address to determine whether you can read their content. They will thus refuse your request if you are using an IP address that’s not on their approved list.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Use Smart Domain Name System (DNS)</h3><p>Clever DNS can evade geoblocking if your smart TV, streaming box, or gaming console doesn’t support VPNs or proxy servers. Some home routers can generate VPN connections, but not all.</p><p>By changing your DNS address, clever DNS may alter your device’s virtual location. Smart DNS replaces your Internet provider’s DNS server. Netflix.com’s IP is not netflix.com. You’ll acquire the smart DNS provider’s transparent DNS proxy IP. Netflix thinks you’re in the US since this proxy server is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/smart-dns-proxy-working.jpg"                      alt="using smart dns for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Connect-to-Proxy-Servers"><a href="#Method-2-Connect-to-Proxy-Servers" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Connect to Proxy Servers"></a>Method 2. Connect to Proxy Servers</h3><p>Rather than connecting you directly to the server housing the material you want, a proxy server functions as an intermediary. A proxy server does what its name implies: it acts on your behalf to get access to the data and then forwards it to you. Proxy servers, especially those in foreign countries, may be used to get around geographical restrictions.</p><p>Depending on the kind of proxy server you use, you may or may not be able to conceal your IP address when surfing the web. Proxy servers are available online and may be accessed from any web browser. Setting up a proxy server is easy, but your activity may still be vulnerable since proxies don’t secure your data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/proxy-caching-illustration.jpg"                      alt="proxy servers for geo blocked sites"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-3-Use-the-Tor-Browser"><a href="#Method-3-Use-the-Tor-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 3.

The Tor browser links to the Tor network, a collection of computers that collaborate to conceal your online footprint by relaying your traffic via several intermediary nodes.</p><p>Tor employs a technique called “onion routing” to conceal its users’ identities. Since more time is required to traverse these additional levels, your internet speed may suffer as a consequence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/use-tor-browser-to-bypass-geo-blocking.jpg"                      alt="tor for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection"><a href="#Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. A Good VPN Connection"></a>Method 4. A Good VPN Connection</h3><p>A virtual private network (VPN) may hide your online identity and protect your data by encrypting your connection. VPNs allow you to get around geographically restricted material by redirecting your connection via a server in another country. This will allow you to connect to VPN servers in other countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, or Australia.</p><p>With <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/pokemon-go/spoof-pokemon-go-location-with-vpn.html" >effective VPN tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can surf the web anonymously, unblock geo-blocked content, and watch your favorite programs abroad.

FAQs About Geo-Blocking"></a>Part 5. FAQs About Geo-Blocking</h2><p>Here are the answers to four questions that you might ask about geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="1-Is-Geo-Blocking-Legal"><a href="#1-Is-Geo-Blocking-Legal" class="headerlink" title="1. Is Geo-Blocking Legal?"></a>1. Is Geo-Blocking Legal?</h3><p>Yes. It’s legitimate. Limiting access to websites and services based on a user’s location is lawful. This practice is routinely used in nations like China to prevent citizens from seeing politically sensitive material. Legal arrangements, such as licensing agreements, may also be enforced by geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal"><a href="#2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal" class="headerlink" title="2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?"></a>2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?</h3><p>It depends. Depending on the situation, the nation, the purpose of the use, and the technique used, geo-blocking circumvention may be against the law. Copyright regulations prohibit users from accessing material beyond its designated location, yet many providers are reluctant to penalize users for doing so.</p><h3 id="3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?"></a>3. What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>Geo-fencing is to create digital fences on which to base real-world judgments about where to go. One may draw a boundary around it using longitude and latitude lines on a map to easily establish who is permitted inside a certain region. Restricting access to material based on a user’s physical location is called “geo-blocking.”</p><h3 id="4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?"></a>4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>They are the same. Restricting a user’s ability to access certain online resources depending on their location is known as geo-blocking or geo-restriction. To safeguard their license agreements, foreign media streaming firms often use the practice of geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>For several reasons, media and content producers use geo-blocking. Although geo-blocking is unlikely to ever go out of style, there are techniques to circumvent it. Use a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass geo-restrictions on the material you want to watch. Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), a proxy server, the Tor network, etc., your online location may be hidden or masked.</p><p>Geo-blocking controls. It’s both useful and abused. Website banning discriminates and manipulates. Geography may be annoying and frustrating. Sadly, they may always be in style. You don’t have to tolerate them!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-win-over-with-these-8-best-free-high-quality-3d-video-apps/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Win Over with These 8 Best Free, High-Quality 3D Video Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-honor-magic-5-lite-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Honor Magic 5 Lite | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-infinix-smart-8-hd-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Infinix Smart 8 HD?

To help you use the VPNa Fake GPS APK, I have listed its features, pros, cons, and even a detailed tutorial.

It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg"                      alt="snap map feature"                ></p><p>This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.</p><p>This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?"></a><strong>Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?</strong></h2><p>The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?</p><p>Yes, Absolutely!</p><p>There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.</p><p><strong>Ghost Mode:</strong> The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg"                      alt="track camera screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile.

Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location setting on snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg"                      alt="duration ghost mode"                ></p><p>If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.</p><p><strong>Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone</strong></p><p>If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg"                      alt="check location notification tray"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on&#x2F;off.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg" alt="tap location on/off"></p><p><strong>iPhone</strong></p><p>To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg"                      alt="go to setting on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg"                      alt="tap privacy option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134496/18498" target="_top" id="2134496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134496/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg"                      alt="click location services option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg"                      alt="turn off location service"                ></p><p>These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location. You must be knowing how to send location on snapchat through chats - even this won’t be possible once you completely turn off the GPS of your devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat</strong></h2><p>If you are wondering how to fake location on snapchat, then the Snapchat location spoofer is one of the best options. You won’t find a specific software designed exclusively for Snapchat but Wondershare’s Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer will help you hide your real location on social media apps. This is how you use the application.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it. You will find several options on the page. Go for ‘Virtual Location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now connect Your Oppo A78 5G to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: The world map with your current location will show up on the page. The ‘Teleport mode’ is the third icon on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it and enter your new location in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once you’ve decided with your final virtual location to fake gps for snapchat, then click on ‘Move Here’. New location will update in your phone and Snapchat will detect it too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="set the location"                ></p><p>One of the advantages of using a location spoofer is that - your new location will reflect in all social media applications. Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.</p><p><strong>VPN Service - NordVPN</strong></p><p>The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn google play store"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg"                      alt="signup for quick connect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg"                      alt="choose the server"                ></p><p>So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions"></a><strong>Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><p><strong>Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.</p><p><strong>Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?</strong></p><p>A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135412/19272" target="_top" id="2135412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135412/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Conclusion"></a><strong>Part 4: Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Samsung Galaxy A54 5G ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Samsung-Galaxy-A54-5G-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Samsung-Galaxy-A54-5G-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Samsung Galaxy A54 5G  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Samsung Galaxy A54 5G  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Samsung-Galaxy-A54-5G-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Samsung-Galaxy-A54-5G-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Samsung Galaxy A54 5G  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Samsung Galaxy A54 5G  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature.

For most devices, the method is common. But for Samsung Galaxy A54 5G  X and 11, the steps are slightly different.

How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.</p><p>- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.</p><p>- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012420/19272" target="_top" id="2012420">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012420" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012420/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Closing-Words"><a href="#Closing-Words" class="headerlink" title="Closing Words"></a>Closing Words</h2><p>Using a mock location app can be fun.

It reroutes your internet traffic to a particular server from a different location. Through this tactic, Netflix fails to detect that you’re using its service from a restricted region. A web proxy server is often free of charge. Thus, it’s a great alternative to VPNs if you don’t want to spend money just to access unavailable content on your device. Do you want to try it now? Here’s how to change your Netflix location using a web proxy server.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose your preferred web proxy server and then visit its official website. Create an account if necessary.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, select a server from the available options. Make sure that the server you’re going to choose is not geologically blocklisted on Netflix.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-6.jpg"                      alt="select a server"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the official web address of Netflix into the URL bar and then proceed immediately.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait while the web proxy server is loading up your request. After a few minutes, the Netflix dashboard must be displayed on your computer screen. From there, you can now browse its catalog and binge-watch the content currently restricted in your region. That’s exactly how to change your location on Netflix with a web proxy server.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-7.jpg"                      alt="stream netflix"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030129/11832" target="_top" id="1030129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030129/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-3-Stream-Netflix-shows-from-the-Tor-browser"><a href="#Method-3-Stream-Netflix-shows-from-the-Tor-browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stream Netflix shows from the Tor browser"></a>Method 3: Stream Netflix shows from the Tor browser</h3><p>Tor browser is primarily used for ultra-private internet browsing.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Apple iPhone X devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”.

Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox.

There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Apple iPhone X device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137976/21526" target="_top" id="2137976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137976/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location.

It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Poco C51 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Poco C51 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Poco C51 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Poco C51 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Poco C51 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Poco C51 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Poco C51 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Poco-C51-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Poco-C51-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Poco C51  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Poco C51  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Poco C51  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Poco-C51-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Poco-C51-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Poco C51  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Poco C51  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012434/19272" target="_top" id="2012434">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012434" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012434/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Poco C51  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Poco C51  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Poco-C51-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Poco-C51-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Poco C51  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Poco C51  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Poco C51  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Poco C51  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Poco C51  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart Poco C51](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Poco" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Poco <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> C51 .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Poco C51 device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Poco C51 device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends"></a>Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends</h3><p>Another tip that can help you resolve to <strong>Find My Friends location not available</strong> is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn’t logged into the feature, you won’t access his&#x2F;her location.</p><p>Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again"><a href="#Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again"></a>Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again</h3><p>Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you’ve faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch.

That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.png"                      alt="sending help alert on life360"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Life360-without-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Life360 without Knowing</h2><p>There are times when you want to turn Life360 off without it showing so that people don’t know your present location. But, if you have no idea how to go about it, you’re in luck. This section covers the best methods to stop sharing your location with friends and family on Life360.</p><h3 id="1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360"><a href="#1-Turn-Off-Your-Circle’s-Location-on-Life360" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360"></a>1. <strong>Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360</strong></h3><p>There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.</p><ul><li>First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.</li><li>Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png"                      alt="locate the circle on life360"                ></p><ul><li>Tap on ‘location sharing’ and click on the slider next to it to disable location sharing.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.jpg"                      alt="click on location sharing"                ></p><ul><li>Now you can recheck the map, and it will show ‘location sharing paused.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-Your-Poco-C51’s-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-off-Your-Poco-C51’s-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn off Your Poco C51’s Airplane Mode"></a>2. <strong>Turn off Your Poco C51’s Airplane Mode</strong></h3><p>Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.</p><p><strong>For your iOS devices</strong>: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>For Android</strong> owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network &amp; internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png"                      alt="turn on airplane mode on android"                ></p><p>These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet. In addition, with the Airplane mode turned on, you can’t make or receive phone calls, either. Therefore, we don’t recommend this as your top choice when learning to turn off Life 360.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Disable-GPS-Service-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3.

If you want some privacy or don’t trust members of your circle, you might want to learn how to turn off Life 360.

When any task that we plan to do, usually already have an application released for the sole purpose of doing that task and needing to do it on your phone. When we message our friends, have a video call with our family, or just simply order food to eat at home, you can do all of them on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device in your palm.</p><p>Another advantage of having our phones with us all the time is that you can also see the current location of either your friend or family.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Nokia C12 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Nokia C12 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Nokia C12 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Nokia C12 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Nokia C12 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Nokia C12 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Nokia C12 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Nokia-C12-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Nokia-C12-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Nokia C12  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Nokia C12  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Nokia C12  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016143/19272" target="_top" id="2016143">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016143" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016143/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Nokia-C12-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Nokia-C12-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Nokia C12  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Nokia C12  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902289/19272" target="_top" id="1902289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902289/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Nokia C12  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Nokia C12  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Nokia-C12-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Nokia-C12-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Nokia C12  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Nokia C12  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Nokia C12  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Nokia C12  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Nokia C12  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart Nokia C12](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Nokia" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Nokia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> C12 .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Nokia C12 device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Nokia C12 device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends"></a>Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends</h3><p>Another tip that can help you resolve to <strong>Find My Friends location not available</strong> is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn’t logged into the feature, you won’t access his&#x2F;her location.</p><p>Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049387/7443" target="_top" id="2049387">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049387" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049387/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again"><a href="#Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again"></a>Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again</h3><p>Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you’ve faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch.

Then, launch the app and select the “Virtual Location” option from the toolkit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The next step is to set up the phone’s connection.

Is there a way to check if someone has stopped sharing their location with you on their Nokia C12 ?</strong></p><p>If someone stops sharing their location with you on their Nokia C12 , you will see “Location Not Available” next to their name in the Find My app or Messages app. You can check the status of location sharing by tapping their name in the Find My app.</p><p><strong>2. Can I track a stolen Nokia C12  if it is turned off?</strong></p><p>You may still be able to track a stolen Nokia C12  if it is turned off using the Find My app or iCloud website.
