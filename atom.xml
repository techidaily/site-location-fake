This is the fastest algorithm available to a user.</td></tr><tr><td>Pseudo-random (1 Pass)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting an entire device with randomly generated numbers in a single pass.</td></tr><tr><td>US Department of Defense, DoD 5220.22-M (3 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting the device in three passes. In the first pass, it overwrites data with zeros, then in the second pass, it overwrites the data with ones, and finally in the third pass overwrites the data with randomly generated bytes. This is a U.S. Department of Defense algorithm.</td></tr><tr><td>US Department of Defense, DoD 5200.22-M (ECE) (7 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting the device in seven passes. The first, fourth, and fifth pass are overwriting with a random byte, its 8 right-bit shift complement, and 16 right-bit shift complement; second and sixth passes are overwriting with zeros, and third and seventh pass with random data. This is a U.S. Department of Defense algorithm.</td></tr><tr><td>B.Schneier’s algorithm (7 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data in seven passes. In the first two passes, it overwrites the device with ones and then zeros, and in the next five passes, it overwrites data with random characters.</td></tr><tr><td>Peter Gutmann (35 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting it 35 times, making recovery of the wiped data by any tool impossible. This algorithm takes more time than other wiping algorithms.</td></tr><tr><td>US-Army AR 380-19 (3 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting the media in three passes. In the first pass, it overwrites data with random bytes, then in the second and third pass, it overwrites data with certain bytes and their complements. This is a U.S. Army algorithm.</td></tr><tr><td>US Air Force, AFSSI 5020(3 passes)</td><td>This algorithm wipes data by overwriting the media in three passes. First, it overwrites with zeros, then with ones, and finally with random characters.</td></tr><tr><td>British HMG IS5 (3 passes)</td><td>This algorithm is a three pass overwriting algorithm, first pass - with zeros, the second pass–with ones and the last pass with random data.</td></tr></tbody></table><p> 9.

Try These 9 Fixes"></a>Getting Text Messages Late on Your iPhone? Try These 9 Fixes</h2><p> Sending and receiving texts should be an instantaneous process. If you’re receiving text messages late on your iPhone, you may miss out on time-sensitive information. It might be an unexpected work meeting or a friend informing you that they couldn’t make it to your date due to an emergency.</p><p> Below, we look at potential solutions you can try when you notice you’re receiving text messages late on your iPhone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537547&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/vcfpro.png"                      border="0"                >Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Check-Your-Phone-Signal"><a href="#1-Check-Your-Phone-Signal" class="headerlink" title="1.

Someone may have texted you 30 minutes ago, but the message isn’t successfully delivered, and your phone can’t receive it until it’s in an area with cellular connectivity.</p><p> To find out if this is the case, look at the cellular signal icon in your iPhone’s status bar. The more vertical bars filled in, the stronger your phone signal strength, and vice versa.</p><p> If you’re experiencing poor cellular connectivity or no signal at all inside a building, for example, you can try going outside to get a stronger signal.</p><p> However, if you continue to see the words<strong>No Service</strong> in the status bar, despite being in a place where everyone else is using their phones without issue, move on to the next fix.</p><h2 id="2-Restart-Your-iPhone"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="2.

Restart Your iPhone</h2><p> If you’re frequently experiencing a lack of cellular service, which is causing you to receive your text messages late, try restarting your device.</p><p> It’s a simple yet effective solution for most connectivity issues like this. Different iPhone models require slightly different steps, so remember to follow the correct instructions when <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >restarting your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Enable-Cellular-Data-or-Connect-to-Wi-Fi"><a href="#3-Enable-Cellular-Data-or-Connect-to-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="3.

When enabled, it turns green. To connect to a Wi-Fi network, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Wi-Fi</strong> and select an available network from the list.</p><h2 id="4-Check-Your-Scheduled-Summary"><a href="#4-Check-Your-Scheduled-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Your Scheduled Summary"></a>4. Check Your Scheduled Summary</h2><p> Scheduled Summary is an iPhone feature that enables you to receive a summary of notifications from an app (or set of apps) at a particular time. This helps you focus better throughout the day as you aren’t getting notified of non-time-sensitive alerts every other minute.</p><p> If you included the Messages app or similar third-party apps in the summary, you won’t get text notifications immediately when your iPhone receives them. Therefore, you may feel that you’re receiving text messages late and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/notifications-dont-show-up-iphone-fixes/" >notifications are not showing up on your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> To solve this, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Scheduled Summary</strong> .

For example, if you have the Do Not Disturb preset to end at 5pm, you’ll only receive all your text messages after that time.</p><p> To avoid receiving text messages late when Do Not Disturb is enabled, scroll back up to the<strong>Allow Notifications</strong> section.

Since it does not have high bandwidth like the reputed VPN services, Hola Fake GPS is unsuitable for streaming Netflix or YouTube from another location.</p><p>However, you can use it to play location-based games like Pokémon Go from another location, access geo-restricted websites, and hide your real location. Hola Fake GPS intercepts your internet request by transmitting your request via a server in a different location, so the website will not know your real location.</p><p>And while masking your real location is the biggest benefit of using Hola Fake GPS, there are potential risks associated with the tool too. For instance, Chrome found that Hola Fake GPS can be qualified as malware, given it collects users’ data and has a history of security breaches.</p><p>Here’s what you have to know about the Hola Fake GPS tool before choosing to use it:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605"                      border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-What-is-Fake-GPS-location-Hola-used-for"><a href="#1-What-is-Fake-GPS-location-Hola-used-for" class="headerlink" title="1.

The interface is really simple to use, and the time spent on the app is always a seamless experience. The security features offered are not that top-notch, but if you are looking for a free application just to change your location, then Hola Fake GPS is the way to go.”</p><p><strong>Sheron on G2 Writes:</strong></p><p>“Hola Fake GPS has been a disappointing experience for me, and I’m pretty sure it will be for you. The attractive pricing and fast speed promise seem like it is the best location spoofer on the internet, but believe me, any other service on the internet is better than this. The company now constantly gets negative feedback from the giants like Google for its privacy violation.

A free VPN service, HolaVPN, can be used to change your IP location to unblock Pokémon Go in these areas.</p><h3 id="1-What-is-HolaVPN"><a href="#1-What-is-HolaVPN" class="headerlink" title="1. What is HolaVPN?"></a>1. What is HolaVPN?</h3><p>HolaVPN is a VPN service that reroutes your internet traffic and hides your IP address. Unlike the Hola Fake GPS, the bandwidth and encryption levels allotted with the HolaVPN service are significant. Plus, it does not alter the location of a chosen application but all the applications on the internet. This means you can play Pokémon from any part of the world, access YouTube from another region, and so on.</p><h3 id="2-Why-Use-HolaVPN-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#2-Why-Use-HolaVPN-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Use HolaVPN in Pokémon Go?"></a>2. Why Use HolaVPN in Pokémon Go?</h3><p>Various situations might prompt you to use HoleVPN in the Pokemon Go game. For example, some countries restrict players from downloading the Pokemon Go game or gaining full access to some in-game features. Also, some Schools and organizations’ networks usually restrict players from playing the Pokemon Go game, so you need a VPN to be able to access the game.</p><h3 id="3-How-to-use-a-HolaVPN-with-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#3-How-to-use-a-HolaVPN-with-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="3. How to use a HolaVPN with Pokémon Go?"></a>3. How to use a HolaVPN with Pokémon Go?</h3><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download the HolaVPN app on your device. Then, launch it and sign in to or create an account.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Spoofing your GPS location on Android or iPhone requires a third-party app. Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is one of the best GPS spoofing apps.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Locate the country you wish to change your location to and tap on it.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’re connected to a particular country, your phone location will change instantly.</p><h3 id="In-conclusion"><a href="#In-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In conclusion"></a>In conclusion</h3><p>Hola Fake GPS location is not the best application to change your GPS location. But if you are simply looking to access a restricted website because of IP location, HolaVPN can be helpful.</p><p>However, it is unsuitable for long-time use. For instance, Hola Fake GPS is known to monitor your online activity and collect information about you. So, it is best to use an advanced application like the Dr.Fone - Virtual Location as shown. As mentioned, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location uses the most advanced technology to spoof your GPS location, so apps like Pokémon Go can’t find your actual GPS location.</p><p>Overall, if you are looking for the ultimate tool to spoof your GPS location, then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the best way to go.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-digital-delinquency-games-comparable-to-gta-v/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Digital Delinquency  Games Comparable to GTA V</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-techniques-for-video-posts-on-discord/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Essential Techniques for Video Posts on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-essential-tips-for-xbox-live-streaming-setup-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Tips for Xbox Live Streaming Setup for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-vision-record-studio-2021/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Vision Record Studio 2021</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-initiating-efficient-conversations-on-snapchat-with-three-steps/"><u>[Updated] Initiating Efficient Conversations on Snapchat with Three Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-iphones-premier-video-tools-pick-cameo-over-filmorago-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] IPhone's Premier Video Tools  Pick Cameo Over FilmoraGo, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/11-best-location-changers-for-honor-magic-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>11 Best Location Changers for Honor Magic 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/11-best-location-changers-for-honor-x50i-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>11 Best Location Changers for Honor X50i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/11-best-location-changers-for-xiaomi-redmi-k70-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>11 Best Location Changers for Xiaomi Redmi K70 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-camera-restored-obs-problem-fixed/"><u>2024 Approved  Camera Restored - OBS Problem Fixed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pro-tips-for-captivating-snapchat-stories/"><u>2024 Approved  Pro Tips for Captivating Snapchat Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Samsung Galaxy A15 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-fake-gps-without-root-on-apple-iphone-xr-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>3 Ways to Fake GPS Without Root On Apple iPhone XR | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-fake-gps-without-root-on-poco-f5-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Fake GPS Without Root On Poco F5 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-fake-gps-without-root-on-realme-gt-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Fake GPS Without Root On Realme GT 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-fake-gps-without-root-on-vivo-v27e-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Fake GPS Without Root On Vivo V27e | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-infinix-note-30-5g-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Infinix Note 30 5G?

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Poco C51 keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works.</em></td><td>4.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Once you change the country’s location on Google Play manually, the Play Store requires 48 hours to accept this modification. Moreover, you can only change the country’s server location once a year. With VPN, many country servers are unreachable, and some servers can be reached only through a paid version. This makes the process expensive and time taking.</p><p>To avoid these hurdles and chaos, we recommend you to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to fake your location on both Android and iOS devices. This tool works in every situation and allows users to travel the globe through their phones free of cost. You can also travel with an exact GPS location just with a single click. Hence, this tool will work amazingly in faking your location without requiring you to change Google Play country’s location.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>Fake location on your phone with a few clicks.</li><li>Support most mainstreaming apps and geo-based games, including Pokemon Go, Snapchat, Tinder, and so on.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>To change country Google Play using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, here are the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose Virtual Location Feature</strong></p><p>Begin with launching the tool of Dr.Fone on your computer.

No one, including your circle members, can spy on what you do on your devices, like checking your internet history or reading texts. Although life360 has many tracking features similar to spy apps, it only provides basic location and text tracking under specific conditions. For people who don’t use Life360 for privacy reasons, what can life360 monitor? Can Life360 see your internet history, or can Life360 see who you text? Here is a brief about everything the app can do and monitor on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-do-with-Life360"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-do-with-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you do with Life360?"></a>Part 2: What can you do with Life360?</h2><p>Life360 is a mobile application that provides family security services that you can download and use for free on Android and IOS. Its basic features include location and driving safety tracking as the application runs in the background. In addition, the application notifies group members if someone in the group is not driving responsibly. Users can also pay for premium perks to access more safety and tracking features for the security of their loved ones.</p><p>There are many valuable features in the life360 app, such as device tracking and locator, which allows you to track your stolen or lost devices. It also allows users to track what other circle members like to do, which route they prefer, and which locations they usually visit.

It does not work when the Poco C50 device is turned off, or its battery is dead.</p><p>The paid features of life360 notify circle members when you text while driving. Even if the user turns this feature off, it will still show that you are doing something on your phone while driving.</p><p>One of the best features of Life360 is the panic button which allows users to send out mass emergency texts to their circle members with their GPS coordinates if they are in danger.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-Life360-see-your-texts"><a href="#Part-3-Can-Life360-see-your-texts" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can Life360 see your texts?"></a>Part 3: Can Life360 see your texts?</h2><p>Although it uses some tracking features, there are limitations on what the app can or cannot do. If you are wondering can life360 see your texts, then the answer is “No”; the app can only see and track your texts under one condition. As Life360 links group members’ devices, it can read texts sent between members of any group. All circle members get notifications when your app is active. Some applications allow users to view the text on someone’s device, like their spouse or partner, but life360 does not compromise the privacy of its users and only shows limited information without any way of spying on others.</p><p>Now, you know that Life360 cannot see your text message, but what can Life360 see? Here are some of the typical functionalities and data that Life360 can see:</p><p><strong>1. Location:</strong> Life360 can track the real-time location of the Poco C50 devices associated with the app. This includes the ability to view the current whereabouts of family members on a map and track their movements over time.</p><p><strong>2. Geofencing:</strong> The app allows you to set up geofences, which are virtual boundaries around specific areas. Life360 can detect when a family member enters or leaves a geofenced location and send notifications accordingly.</p><p><strong>3. Driving behavior:</strong> Life360 offers features to monitor driving behavior, such as detecting speed, hard braking, and rapid acceleration. It can provide insights into how safely someone is driving and notify other family members of any concerning events.</p><p><strong>4. Crash detection:</strong> Life360 also includes a crash detection feature that uses sensors in the Poco C50 device to detect potential car accidents. In such cases, the app can automatically send alerts to emergency contacts.</p><p><strong>5. Check-ins and notifications:</strong> You can manually check in at specific locations to let your family members know you have arrived safely. Life360 also allows for sending notifications and messages within the app.</p><p><strong>6. Battery level:</strong> Life360 may have access to the battery level of the Poco C50 devices connected to the app. This information can be used to provide alerts when a family member’s device is low on battery.</p><p>It’s important to note that while Life360 is designed to facilitate family communication and safety, the extent of data visibility and tracking can vary based on the settings and permissions configured within the app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-stop-Life360-from-seeing-your-location-data"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-stop-Life360-from-seeing-your-location-data" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to stop Life360 from seeing your location data?"></a>Part 5: How to stop Life360 from seeing your location data?</h2><p>Life360 can only have limited access to your texts, but it tracks your location as long as the app runs in the background and the location services are on.

There are zero cons to using Life360 for its intended purpose.</p><p><strong>FAQ 2: My Wi-Fi is Off. Can people still see my location on Life360?</strong></p><p>Unless your location services are Off, your location might still be viewable on Life360 as data can be transmitted over cellular as well as Wi-Fi. So, switching Wi-Fi off will not prevent users from seeing your location on Life360.</p><p><strong>FAQ 3: How can I hide my Life360 history?</strong></p><p>There is no way to hide your Life360 history. There are only two ways to remove your Life360 history, though – deleting the Life360 account itself or removing a device from the Life360 Circle. If you are a minor trying to wriggle your way out of some trouble, removing yourself from the Circle or deleting your account is a sure-fire way of getting you into more trouble!</p><p><strong>FAQ 4: Isn’t Life360 an invasion of privacy?</strong></p><p>Life360 is designed for parents to always stay informed about the digital well-being of their children and their location. Children might think this is an invasion of privacy but given what’s out there on the internet and in the world, parents are rightfully concerned. If you are using Life360 as a rudimentary spyware to track your ex or any such purposes, then that is on you and that is an invasion of their privacy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope reading this article helped relieve your concerns about the Life360 app. Can you track text messages with life360 “Yes” the app tracks your location through texts but can life360 read texts, or can life360 see who you text, “No” because it cannot monitor all your device’s actions. The device can see if you are texting others. Still, it cannot store any data, so you can privately communicate with people inside or outside your circle.

Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo Reno 8T device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

The interface is really simple to use, and the time spent on the app is always a seamless experience. The security features offered are not that top-notch, but if you are looking for a free application just to change your location, then Hola Fake GPS is the way to go.”</p><p><strong>Sheron on G2 Writes:</strong></p><p>“Hola Fake GPS has been a disappointing experience for me, and I’m pretty sure it will be for you. The attractive pricing and fast speed promise seem like it is the best location spoofer on the internet, but believe me, any other service on the internet is better than this.

You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things.

The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up.

However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes.

You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg"                      alt="drfone-change-location-pic-7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned.

But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional.

But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.</p><p>One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players.

You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.</p><p>So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653808&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4"                ></p><p>There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end.

You have very little apps to choose from the play store.</p><p>If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -</p><p><strong>VPNs</strong> - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5"                ></p><p><strong>Apps on App Store</strong> - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else.

The app can be used as a location-sharing platform as well as you can chat with your friends via the in-app chat feature. Here are the basics. All this app suggests is that a group of people whether an office projects group or simply a college team or maybe the family members, download and <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/life360/" >install Life360 on their phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Mind that the app supports iPhone and Android (6 and above) devices.</p><p>After the app gets installed, you can create a circle, which in other languages simply means a group, just like you create on Facebook or WhatsApp. This circle is having members who can share the information and location accountability with each other. You can also give invitations to other users by simply taking the help of their contact numbers or email addresses.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/cit_win/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >CollageIt Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/life360-intro.jpg"                      alt="life360 app"                ></p><p>Using this app then, you can simply see the location of the other members as well as get notifications named Place Alerts. These notifications will tell you whether a user has arrived or left the selected location. This can be helpful if you are a parent and want your children to reach safely at a desired place.</p><p>Moreover, with the help of Life360, a user can easily control the ‘Check-in’ according to which he or she sends the alert to the circle to know them the exact location. You can also get to see the location history of the members to know their past locations.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Do-People-Hate-Being-Tracked-by-Life360"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Do-People-Hate-Being-Tracked-by-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?"></a>Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?</h2><p>Unarguably Life360 can be considered one of the most helpful and fun apps. But the thing that sometimes or many times might bother people is the 24x7 interference with privacy.</p><p>For instance, spouses can monitor their better half and if any one of them does not understand enough, they can put various questions for your particular location and it may create chaos as a result. Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place. Having Life360 and being tracked by it can simply spoil the surprise as well.</p><p>For these reasons, a lot of people sum up the app as an intervention for their privacy. And for those who love their privacy, hating being tracked by Life360 is completely natural to them.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Stop-Life360-Tracking-vs-Spoofing-Life360"><a href="#Part-3-Stop-Life360-Tracking-vs-Spoofing-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360"></a>Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360</h2><p>To stop or to spoof, that is the question! Yes, when you are annoyed with being tracked by Life360, you can have two options with you. Either you can stop Life360 tracking or spoof Life360 tracking. But what goes best? You might be wondering the same. For many of you, simply stopping the app and logging out from it can be a plain solution. However, we don’t support this. To us, the faking location on Life360 is much better.</p><ul><li>This is because firstly, if you log out and completely stop using the app, your members will get a notification for the same. To this, their curiosity will arise and none of them will stop questioning from you. To avoid this, we suggest spoofing Life360 location and not stopping it.</li><li>Secondly, this may be fun as you can show off to your friends that you are traveling somewhere else. The list of friends may include those who are jealous of you. And this is the best way to double up their jealousy.</li><li>Thirdly, if you tell the actual location of your device every time, many of the members, who are not having good intentions, can trace your routine and anything wrong can happen to you. Spoofing location can be a good way to trick them and catch their intentions.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Fake your Life360 location to any other address you require with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.</p><ul><li>Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone&#x2F;Android.</li><li>Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.</li><li>There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings"><a href="#6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings"></a>6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings</h3><p>Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you.

But as mentioned earlier, there are some Netflix shows that are not available worldwide.</p><p>There are many potential reasons why Netflix shows vary from one region to another. One of them is cultural influence. Of course, Netflix prioritizes the screening of shows that are highly relatable for the target audience. Hence, the content available in certain locations is locally sourced or regionally concentrated. But that’s not all. There are other reasons why Netflix offers different shows in every country.

It reroutes your internet traffic to a particular server from a different location. Through this tactic, Netflix fails to detect that you’re using its service from a restricted region. A web proxy server is often free of charge. Thus, it’s a great alternative to VPNs if you don’t want to spend money just to access unavailable content on your device. Do you want to try it now? Here’s how to change your Netflix location using a web proxy server.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose your preferred web proxy server and then visit its official website. Create an account if necessary.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, select a server from the available options. Make sure that the server you’re going to choose is not geologically blocklisted on Netflix.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-6.jpg"                      alt="select a server"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the official web address of Netflix into the URL bar and then proceed immediately.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait while the web proxy server is loading up your request. After a few minutes, the Netflix dashboard must be displayed on your computer screen. From there, you can now browse its catalog and binge-watch the content currently restricted in your region. That’s exactly how to change your location on Netflix with a web proxy server.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BOutlook%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/outlook-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-7.jpg"                      alt="stream netflix"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stream-Netflix-shows-from-the-Tor-browser"><a href="#Method-3-Stream-Netflix-shows-from-the-Tor-browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stream Netflix shows from the Tor browser"></a>Method 3: Stream Netflix shows from the Tor browser</h3><p>Tor browser is primarily used for ultra-private internet browsing.

When any task that we plan to do, usually already have an application released for the sole purpose of doing that task and needing to do it on your phone. When we message our friends, have a video call with our family, or just simply order food to eat at home, you can do all of them on the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device in your palm.</p><p>Another advantage of having our phones with us all the time is that you can also see the current location of either your friend or family. For Apple phone users, they have an app that is called “Find My Friends” that will show you the locations of the people that you are tracking. But what if you cannot find the location of the friend? We will find out the causes as to why no location can be found and how you can fix this in just a few simple steps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4708689&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Win： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Why-does-an-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-say-“no-location-found”"><a href="#Part-1-Why-does-an-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-say-“no-location-found”" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why does an Oppo Find X7 Ultra say “no location found”?"></a>Part 1: Why does an Oppo Find X7 Ultra say “no location found”?</h2><p>When you are searching for your friend’s current location and it shows that “no location found”, there could be numerous reasons as to why that is happening.
