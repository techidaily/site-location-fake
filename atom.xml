It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Motorola Moto G14 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Motorola Moto G14 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Motorola Moto G14 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Motorola Moto G14 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Motorola Moto G14 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Motorola Moto G14 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Motorola Moto G14 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-Moto-G14-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-Moto-G14-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola Moto G14  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola Moto G14  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Motorola Moto G14  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_672" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/1959812/17834/" width="720" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Tip 3: Adjust Motorola Moto G14  Date and Time<p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Motorola Moto G14  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Motorola Moto G14  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it.

You need to have a security measure to ensure data you’re receiving is coming from a legitimate source instead of a malicious one. It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.</p><p>Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.</p><p><strong>Food Delivery</strong></p><p>Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to. They may also gain an unfair advantage to gain priority in order queues and report longer rides to earn more from the platform. In addition, a more egregious issue is couriers charging for deliveries that weren’t made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-03.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing on food delivery driver apps"                ></p><p><strong>Gaming</strong></p><p>Using GPS spoofing in MMORPGs enables gamers to take advantage of faking their position without moving into the comforts of their own home. This can lead to more in-game rewards that are otherwise difficult to achieve without GPS spoofing.</p><p>Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.</p><p><strong>Social Media</strong></p><p>Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.</p><p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p><p>Most financial institutions across the globe use location data to verify users to prevent fraud. Having inaccurate data is a major security beach, especially when handling financial service apps on the internet.</p><p>There are various ways to protect yourself from being on the other end of a fake GPS location. You can easily use specialized apps, including <a class="link"   href="https://apkpure.com/mock-location-root-detector/com.check.mock" >mock location detection APKs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you’re on Android.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Motorola Moto G13 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Motorola Moto G13 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Motorola Moto G13 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Motorola Moto G13 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Motorola Moto G13 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Motorola Moto G13 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Motorola Moto G13 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-Moto-G13-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-Moto-G13-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola Moto G13  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola Moto G13  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Motorola Moto G13  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Motorola-Moto-G13-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Motorola-Moto-G13-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Motorola Moto G13  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Motorola Moto G13  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Motorola Moto G13  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Motorola Moto G13  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Motorola-Moto-G13-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Motorola-Moto-G13-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Motorola Moto G13  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Motorola Moto G13  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone.

It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.</p><p>The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Motorola Moto G04 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Motorola Moto G04 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Motorola Moto G04 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Motorola Moto G04 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Motorola Moto G04 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Motorola Moto G04 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Motorola Moto G04 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-Moto-G04-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-Moto-G04-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola Moto G04  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola Moto G04  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Motorola Moto G04  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Motorola-Moto-G04-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Motorola-Moto-G04-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Motorola Moto G04  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Motorola Moto G04  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection.

Once you change the country’s location on Google Play manually, the Play Store requires 48 hours to accept this modification. Moreover, you can only change the country’s server location once a year. With VPN, many country servers are unreachable, and some servers can be reached only through a paid version. This makes the process expensive and time taking.</p><p>To avoid these hurdles and chaos, we recommend you to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to fake your location on both Android and iOS devices. This tool works in every situation and allows users to travel the globe through their phones free of cost. You can also travel with an exact GPS location just with a single click. Hence, this tool will work amazingly in faking your location without requiring you to change Google Play country’s location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>Fake location on your phone with a few clicks.</li><li>Support most mainstreaming apps and geo-based games, including Pokemon Go, Snapchat, Tinder, and so on.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>To change country Google Play using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, here are the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose Virtual Location Feature</strong></p><p>Begin with launching the tool of Dr.Fone on your computer.

Here we will answer your various questions about Life360, including, can Life360 see internet history, read or show text, etc. You will also learn how to stop life360 from seeing your location data or texts.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-Life360-a-spy-app"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Life360-a-spy-app" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is Life360 a spy app?"></a>Part 1: Is Life360 a spy app?</h2><p>You might have learned from your friends or social media about various applications that allow you to track other devices, view text messages, and track everything someone does on their device. No one, including your circle members, can spy on what you do on your devices, like checking your internet history or reading texts. Although life360 has many tracking features similar to spy apps, it only provides basic location and text tracking under specific conditions. For people who don’t use Life360 for privacy reasons, what can life360 monitor? Can Life360 see your internet history, or can Life360 see who you text? Here is a brief about everything the app can do and monitor on your phone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605"                      border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-do-with-Life360"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-do-with-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you do with Life360?"></a>Part 2: What can you do with Life360?</h2><p>Life360 is a mobile application that provides family security services that you can download and use for free on Android and IOS. Its basic features include location and driving safety tracking as the application runs in the background. In addition, the application notifies group members if someone in the group is not driving responsibly. Users can also pay for premium perks to access more safety and tracking features for the security of their loved ones.</p><p>There are many valuable features in the life360 app, such as device tracking and locator, which allows you to track your stolen or lost devices. It also allows users to track what other circle members like to do, which route they prefer, and which locations they usually visit. Unfortunately, the app only runs when the location services on any device are turned on, and the user permits it to run in the background. It does not work when the Motorola Moto G04 device is turned off, or its battery is dead.</p><p>The paid features of life360 notify circle members when you text while driving. Even if the user turns this feature off, it will still show that you are doing something on your phone while driving.</p><p>One of the best features of Life360 is the panic button which allows users to send out mass emergency texts to their circle members with their GPS coordinates if they are in danger.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-Life360-see-your-texts"><a href="#Part-3-Can-Life360-see-your-texts" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can Life360 see your texts?"></a>Part 3: Can Life360 see your texts?</h2><p>Although it uses some tracking features, there are limitations on what the app can or cannot do. If you are wondering can life360 see your texts, then the answer is “No”; the app can only see and track your texts under one condition. As Life360 links group members’ devices, it can read texts sent between members of any group. All circle members get notifications when your app is active. Some applications allow users to view the text on someone’s device, like their spouse or partner, but life360 does not compromise the privacy of its users and only shows limited information without any way of spying on others.</p><p>Now, you know that Life360 cannot see your text message, but what can Life360 see? Here are some of the typical functionalities and data that Life360 can see:</p><p><strong>1. Location:</strong> Life360 can track the real-time location of the Motorola Moto G04 devices associated with the app. This includes the ability to view the current whereabouts of family members on a map and track their movements over time.</p><p><strong>2. Geofencing:</strong> The app allows you to set up geofences, which are virtual boundaries around specific areas. Life360 can detect when a family member enters or leaves a geofenced location and send notifications accordingly.</p><p><strong>3. Driving behavior:</strong> Life360 offers features to monitor driving behavior, such as detecting speed, hard braking, and rapid acceleration. It can provide insights into how safely someone is driving and notify other family members of any concerning events.</p><p><strong>4. Crash detection:</strong> Life360 also includes a crash detection feature that uses sensors in the Motorola Moto G04 device to detect potential car accidents. In such cases, the app can automatically send alerts to emergency contacts.</p><p><strong>5. Check-ins and notifications:</strong> You can manually check in at specific locations to let your family members know you have arrived safely. Life360 also allows for sending notifications and messages within the app.</p><p><strong>6. Battery level:</strong> Life360 may have access to the battery level of the Motorola Moto G04 devices connected to the app. This information can be used to provide alerts when a family member’s device is low on battery.</p><p>It’s important to note that while Life360 is designed to facilitate family communication and safety, the extent of data visibility and tracking can vary based on the settings and permissions configured within the app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599952&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>Epubor Ultimate for Mac:Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-stop-Life360-from-seeing-your-location-data"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-stop-Life360-from-seeing-your-location-data" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to stop Life360 from seeing your location data?"></a>Part 5: How to stop Life360 from seeing your location data?</h2><p>Life360 can only have limited access to your texts, but it tracks your location as long as the app runs in the background and the location services are on. For those of you who wonder, does life360 alert you when someone checks your locations? The answer is no because no Android or iOS application has that feature. So, all group members can track your location or see your location history all the time. Here is how you can stop life360 from seeing your location.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a location changer application that teleports your GPS location to anywhere you want with a single click. It is the best tool to fool all location tracking-based Android or IOS applications, including Life360. Users can fake their location by stimulating GPS location with a joystick and drawing a fake route on a 360-degree map. It also allows you to play location-based games on your device without moving a single step.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-2"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-2" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Open the Dr.Fone software on your computer and connect your phone.

There are zero cons to using Life360 for its intended purpose.</p><p><strong>FAQ 2: My Wi-Fi is Off. Can people still see my location on Life360?</strong></p><p>Unless your location services are Off, your location might still be viewable on Life360 as data can be transmitted over cellular as well as Wi-Fi. So, switching Wi-Fi off will not prevent users from seeing your location on Life360.</p><p><strong>FAQ 3: How can I hide my Life360 history?</strong></p><p>There is no way to hide your Life360 history. There are only two ways to remove your Life360 history, though – deleting the Life360 account itself or removing a device from the Life360 Circle. If you are a minor trying to wriggle your way out of some trouble, removing yourself from the Circle or deleting your account is a sure-fire way of getting you into more trouble!</p><p><strong>FAQ 4: Isn’t Life360 an invasion of privacy?</strong></p><p>Life360 is designed for parents to always stay informed about the digital well-being of their children and their location. Children might think this is an invasion of privacy but given what’s out there on the internet and in the world, parents are rightfully concerned. If you are using Life360 as a rudimentary spyware to track your ex or any such purposes, then that is on you and that is an invasion of their privacy.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope reading this article helped relieve your concerns about the Life360 app. Can you track text messages with life360 “Yes” the app tracks your location through texts but can life360 read texts, or can life360 see who you text, “No” because it cannot monitor all your device’s actions. The device can see if you are texting others. Still, it cannot store any data, so you can privately communicate with people inside or outside your circle.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-Moto-G-Stylus-2023-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-Moto-G-Stylus-2023-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Motorola-Moto-G-Stylus-2023-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Motorola-Moto-G-Stylus-2023-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-spreadsheet-free-excel-editor-online-offline-1x.93e269d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Toggle on the option to enable it.

For most devices, the method is common. But for Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023)](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Motorola" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Motorola <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Moto G Stylus (2023) .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) device to shut down.

Life360 is monitoring software that can be downloaded into your Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) and used by the individuals who are part of your Family Circle to monitor your location and the location of anybody else who is part of your Family Circle.</p><p>The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers. In addition, life360 will store your location and send it to your social networks automatically.</p><p>Life360 is not required to track your location, but it is required to send your location to your social networks.</p><p>If you want to know more about Life360, check out our Life360 Review.</p><p>When it comes to privacy, many people are becoming more aware of how it is being violated.

Unfortunately, it also means that no one can see where they are about one another or how long it has been since they last updated their position.</p><p>If the necessity ever arose, such an undertaking may be useful for maintaining one’s privacy. However, customers have no idea that Life 360 may still be used to monitor them by other people.</p><p>Premium users will still have access to the last 30 days’ worth of location data, so the other person will be able to see where you were last seen.</p><h2 id="Part-3-3-Ways-to-Stop-Life360-from-Tracking-You"><a href="#Part-3-3-Ways-to-Stop-Life360-from-Tracking-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You"></a>Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You</h2><h3 id="1-Low-Data-Consumption"><a href="#1-Low-Data-Consumption" class="headerlink" title="1.

Setting Wi-Fi and Data Services to “Off.”</h3><p>Another typical method kids use to prevent their parents from monitoring their position is to disable Life360’s Wi-Fi and Data. It works like this. If you don’t want applications updating in the background, enable power-saving mode.</p><p>Use a wired connection. Adolescents can turn off Wi-Fi and data when using the Life360 app on an iPhone. Go to Settings, look for Life360, and disable Cellular Data, Background Refresh, and Motion &amp; Fitness. You’ll be able to keep track of where you are on Life360.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg"                      alt="low data consumption"                ></p><p>All these methods can be used to Stop Life360 from Tracking You.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Motorola G54 5G ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Motorola G54 5G device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Motorola G54 5G device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Motorola G54 5G device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Motorola G54 5G device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Motorola G54 5G device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Motorola G54 5G device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-G54-5G-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-G54-5G-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola G54 5G  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola G54 5G  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Motorola G54 5G  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901410&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Pro - Software based live production. vMix Pro includes everything in vMix 4K plus 8 channels of Replay and 8 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing.

The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Motorola G24 Power ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Motorola G24 Power device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Motorola G24 Power device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Motorola G24 Power device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Motorola G24 Power device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Motorola G24 Power device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Motorola G24 Power device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-G24-Power-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Motorola-G24-Power-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola G24 Power  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Motorola G24 Power  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available?

How to Bypass Hulu Error Codes?</h3><p>While connecting Hulu using a VPN, you may encounter several errors like errors 16, 400, 406, and others with each of them having different issues like connection, account, server, and more. Depending on the type of type and meaning of the error, you can try bypassing and fixing it.</p><p>For Hulu errors 3 and 5 that are regarding connection issues, you can try to restart the streaming device and also restart your router. For error 16 that shows invalid region issues, you need to use a VPN that can help you bypass the region blocks of Hulu. Some of the other possible ways to fix different code error issues include reinstalling or updating the Hulu app, checking the internet connection, removing the Motorola G24 Power device from the account, and adding it again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364"                      border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Q3-How-to-fix-the-Hulu-Home-Location-Errors"><a href="#Q3-How-to-fix-the-Hulu-Home-Location-Errors" class="headerlink" title="Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Motorola G24 Power devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600113&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Win：Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus Nord 3 5G ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device, while “Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Nord-3-5G-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Nord-3-5G-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Nord 3 5G  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Nord 3 5G  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus Nord 3 5G  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42570605&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/usbXcopy/Nero_USB_x_copy_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing.

The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-sharing-videos-on-tweet-no-retweets-just-phones/"><u>[New] Sharing Videos on Tweet  No Retweets, Just Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-diverse-technology-scrutiny-easeus-edition/"><u>[Updated] Diverse Technology Scrutiny  EaseUS Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-outreach-with-strategic-partner-selection-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Outreach with Strategic Partner Selection on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-syncing-twitter-and-snapchat-for-sharing-videos/"><u>[Updated] Syncing Twitter & Snapchat for Sharing Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-infinix-zero-5g-2023-turbo-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-oppo-reno-8t-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Oppo Reno 8T 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-vivo-v27-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Vivo V27 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/11-best-location-changers-for-apple-iphone-13-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>11 Best Location Changers for Apple iPhone 13 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/11-best-location-changers-for-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>11 Best Location Changers for Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-ultimate-tips-for-youtube-content-creation-excellence/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate Tips for YouTube Content Creation Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-honor-v-purse-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Honor V Purse | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-realme-12-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Realme 12 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-xiaomi-13t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Xiaomi 13T | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-lava-storm-5g-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Lava Storm 5G?

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus Ace 3 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the OnePlus Ace 3 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the OnePlus Ace 3 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Ace 3 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the OnePlus Ace 3 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the OnePlus Ace 3 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Ace 3 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Ace-3-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Ace-3-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Ace 3  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Ace 3  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus Ace 3  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again<p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus Ace 2V ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the OnePlus Ace 2V device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the OnePlus Ace 2V device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Ace 2V device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the OnePlus Ace 2V device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the OnePlus Ace 2V device, while “Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Ace 2V device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Ace-2V-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Ace-2V-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Ace 2V  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Ace 2V  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus Ace 2V  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-Ace-2V-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-Ace-2V-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Ace 2V  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Ace 2V  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DBanner%2B728x90"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/2e76fe6a-3010-1b37-7846-f34ff9c6b4ca.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the OnePlus Ace 2V  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For OnePlus Ace 2V  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-OnePlus-Ace-2V-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-OnePlus-Ace-2V-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Ace 2V  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Ace 2V  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for OnePlus Ace 2V  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other OnePlus Ace 2V  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For OnePlus Ace 2V  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart OnePlus Ace 2V](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-OnePlus" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-OnePlus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Ace 2V .jpg)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BConverter%2BBox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/8020c1dc-518e-3bdf-6e7b-e6d1bdf1597b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the OnePlus Ace 2V device to shut down.

Thus, your location settings show modified coordinates whenever you browse the internet with a VPN enabled. That also works with streaming Netflix shows that are currently restricted in your region. Do you want to try it? Here’s a short guide on how to change your location on Netflix using Virtual Private Networks.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First and foremost, check the current standing of your Netflix account and make sure it is active. Once confirmed, choose your preferred VPN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-do-you-change-your-location-on-netflix-4.jpg"                      alt="active netflix account"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Then, download and install your selected Virtual Private Network.

It reroutes your internet traffic to a particular server from a different location. Through this tactic, Netflix fails to detect that you’re using its service from a restricted region. A web proxy server is often free of charge. Thus, it’s a great alternative to VPNs if you don’t want to spend money just to access unavailable content on your device. Do you want to try it now? Here’s how to change your Netflix location using a web proxy server.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose your preferred web proxy server and then visit its official website. Create an account if necessary.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, select a server from the available options.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus Ace 2 Pro ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device, while “Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_672" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/1959812/17834/" width="720" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Final Words<p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

The third-party cookies also monitor the content type you have visited and your personal information, which is risky.</p><p>Besides invading privacy, the CST also poses several other issues.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="8-Solutions-to-Fix-‘Find-My-Friends-Location-Not-Available’-On-OnePlus-Ace-2"><a href="#8-Solutions-to-Fix-‘Find-My-Friends-Location-Not-Available’-On-OnePlus-Ace-2" class="headerlink" title="8 Solutions to Fix ‘Find My Friends Location Not Available’ On OnePlus Ace 2"></a>8 Solutions to Fix ‘Find My Friends Location Not Available’ On OnePlus Ace 2</h2><p>There is no doubt that Find My Friends is an excellent application for location tracking. It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus Ace 2 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the OnePlus Ace 2 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the OnePlus Ace 2 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Ace 2 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the OnePlus Ace 2 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the OnePlus Ace 2 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus Ace 2 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Ace-2-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-Ace-2-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Ace 2  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus Ace 2  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus Ace 2  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-Ace-2-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-Ace-2-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Ace 2  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Ace 2  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the OnePlus Ace 2  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For OnePlus Ace 2  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-OnePlus-Ace-2-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-OnePlus-Ace-2-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Ace 2  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Ace 2  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for OnePlus Ace 2  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other OnePlus Ace 2  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For OnePlus Ace 2  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart OnePlus Ace 2](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-OnePlus" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-OnePlus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Ace 2 .jpg)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the OnePlus Ace 2 device to shut down.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus 12R ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the OnePlus 12R device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the OnePlus 12R device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus 12R device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the OnePlus 12R device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the OnePlus 12R device, while “Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus 12R device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-12R-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-12R-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus 12R  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus 12R  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus 12R  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-12R-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-12R-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus 12R  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus 12R  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the OnePlus 12R  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off.

The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.</p><p>As of now, you cannot run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> as it is only available for Android and iOS. <em>Why?</em> Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the <strong><em>Life360 app for Windows</em></strong>. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the <strong><em>Life360 app on Windows</em></strong>.</p><p>So, without wasting another second, let’s dive straight into the guide.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC"><a href="#Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?"></a>Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?</h2><p>First things first; why would anyone want to use a family locator app like Life360 on their PC? Well, the truth is everyone has their own reason to get <strong><em>Life360 for PC</em></strong>. For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.</p><p>In this situation, you can simply run the <strong><em>Life360 app on PC</em></strong>. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.</p><p>Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?"></a>Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?</h2><p>Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.</p><p>The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.</p><p>However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and <strong><em>run the app on a Windows PC</em></strong>. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.</p><p>These methods include:</p><h2 id="Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator"></a>Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator</h2><p>The first and the most convenient way to run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> is to use an Android Emulator. An emulator is basically a software that creates a virtual Android system on your computer. As a result, you’ll be able to run Android apps on your computer.</p><p>While there are dozens of Android emulators, Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and user-friendly option among all.

For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.</p><p>In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em></strong>. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.</p><p>Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.</p><p>Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus 12 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not!

Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus 12  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location.

It was developed by Microsoft and uses a GRE tunnel with a TCP control channel to bypass various geo-based restrictions. Since free PPTP VPN has been around for years now and is pretty easy to setup, it is quite popular as well. Read on and learn the basics of PPTP VPN free with a free PPTP VPN list as well.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-PPTP-VPN"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-PPTP-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?"></a>Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?</h2><p>The free VPN PPTP was earlier introduced by Windows, but was later adopted by all the other platforms like Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Even though the layer of encryption in free PPTP VPN is not as secure as other protocols, it makes it pretty fast. Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.</p><ul><li>The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.</li><li>Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.</li><li>It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.</li><li>It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).</li><li>Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.</li><li>The tunneling is of two types in PPTP – Voluntary and Compulsory. Voluntary tunneling is initiated from the client’s end while compulsory tunneling is initiated from the server’s end. Compulsory tunneling should be supported by the router.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-1.jpg"                      alt="free pptp vpn connection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>By attaining a free VPN PPTP server, you can easily connect to it.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus 11R ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the OnePlus 11R device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the OnePlus 11R device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus 11R device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the OnePlus 11R device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the OnePlus 11R device, while “Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus 11R device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-11R-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-11R-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus 11R  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus 11R  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus 11R  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-11R-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-11R-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus 11R  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus 11R  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the OnePlus 11R  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For OnePlus 11R  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”.

It also allows you to play location-based games on your device without moving a single step.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Open the Dr.Fone software on your computer and connect your phone.

There are zero cons to using Life360 for its intended purpose.</p><p><strong>FAQ 2: My Wi-Fi is Off. Can people still see my location on Life360?</strong></p><p>Unless your location services are Off, your location might still be viewable on Life360 as data can be transmitted over cellular as well as Wi-Fi. So, switching Wi-Fi off will not prevent users from seeing your location on Life360.</p><p><strong>FAQ 3: How can I hide my Life360 history?</strong></p><p>There is no way to hide your Life360 history. There are only two ways to remove your Life360 history, though – deleting the Life360 account itself or removing a device from the Life360 Circle. If you are a minor trying to wriggle your way out of some trouble, removing yourself from the Circle or deleting your account is a sure-fire way of getting you into more trouble!</p><p><strong>FAQ 4: Isn’t Life360 an invasion of privacy?</strong></p><p>Life360 is designed for parents to always stay informed about the digital well-being of their children and their location. Children might think this is an invasion of privacy but given what’s out there on the internet and in the world, parents are rightfully concerned. If you are using Life360 as a rudimentary spyware to track your ex or any such purposes, then that is on you and that is an invasion of their privacy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope reading this article helped relieve your concerns about the Life360 app. Can you track text messages with life360 “Yes” the app tracks your location through texts but can life360 read texts, or can life360 see who you text, “No” because it cannot monitor all your device’s actions. The device can see if you are texting others. Still, it cannot store any data, so you can privately communicate with people inside or outside your circle.

But what's better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.<ul><li><strong>Automatic GPS movement:</strong> Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with OnePlus 11 5G ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the OnePlus 11 5G device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the OnePlus 11 5G device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus 11 5G device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the OnePlus 11 5G device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the OnePlus 11 5G device, while “Location Not Available” means that the OnePlus 11 5G device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-11-5G-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-OnePlus-11-5G-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus 11 5G  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location OnePlus 11 5G  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your OnePlus 11 5G  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://martinic.evyy.net/c/5597632/1422856/4482" target="_top" id="1422856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1422856"                      border="0" alt="" width="580" height="309"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-11-5G-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-11-5G-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus 11 5G  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus 11 5G  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Nubia Z50S Pro ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Nubia Z50S Pro device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Nubia Z50S Pro device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Nubia Z50S Pro device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Nubia Z50S Pro device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Nubia Z50S Pro device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Nubia Z50S Pro device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Nubia-Z50S-Pro-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Nubia-Z50S-Pro-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Nubia Z50S Pro  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Nubia Z50S Pro  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Nubia Z50S Pro  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Nubia-Z50S-Pro-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Nubia-Z50S-Pro-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Nubia Z50S Pro  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Nubia Z50S Pro  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Nubia Z50S Pro  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Nubia Z50S Pro  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40085955&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f702defbc67edb455949f46babab0c18/products/2_logo9.png"                      border="0"                >FX PRO (Gold Robot + Silver Robot(Basic Package))</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Nubia-Z50S-Pro-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Nubia-Z50S-Pro-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Nubia Z50S Pro  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Nubia Z50S Pro  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Nubia Z50S Pro  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Nubia Z50S Pro  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Nubia Z50S Pro  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart Nubia Z50S Pro](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Nubia" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Nubia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Z50S Pro .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Nubia Z50S Pro device to shut down.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Nubia Z50 Ultra ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Nubia Z50 Ultra device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Nubia Z50 Ultra device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Nubia Z50 Ultra device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Nubia Z50 Ultra device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Nubia Z50 Ultra device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Nubia Z50 Ultra device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Nubia-Z50-Ultra-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Nubia-Z50-Ultra-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Nubia Z50 Ultra  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Nubia Z50 Ultra  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Nubia Z50 Ultra  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4610657&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/emeditor_chat_ai.png"                      border="0"                ><br>EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows.

If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings.

There is a chance that location is not available on the Nubia Z50 Ultra  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Nubia Z50 Ultra  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Nubia-Z50-Ultra-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Nubia-Z50-Ultra-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Nubia Z50 Ultra  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Nubia Z50 Ultra  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Nubia Z50 Ultra  X and 11, the steps are slightly different.
