Mind that the app supports iPhone and Android (6 and above) devices.</p><p>After the app gets installed, you can create a circle, which in other languages simply means a group, just like you create on Facebook or WhatsApp. This circle is having members who can share the information and location accountability with each other. You can also give invitations to other users by simply taking the help of their contact numbers or email addresses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/life360-intro.jpg"                      alt="life360 app"                ></p><p>Using this app then, you can simply see the location of the other members as well as get notifications named Place Alerts. These notifications will tell you whether a user has arrived or left the selected location. This can be helpful if you are a parent and want your children to reach safely at a desired place.</p><p>Moreover, with the help of Life360, a user can easily control the ‘Check-in’ according to which he or she sends the alert to the circle to know them the exact location. You can also get to see the location history of the members to know their past locations.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Do-People-Hate-Being-Tracked-by-Life360"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Do-People-Hate-Being-Tracked-by-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?"></a>Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?</h2><p>Unarguably Life360 can be considered one of the most helpful and fun apps. But the thing that sometimes or many times might bother people is the 24x7 interference with privacy.</p><p>For instance, spouses can monitor their better half and if any one of them does not understand enough, they can put various questions for your particular location and it may create chaos as a result. Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place. Having Life360 and being tracked by it can simply spoil the surprise as well.</p><p>For these reasons, a lot of people sum up the app as an intervention for their privacy. And for those who love their privacy, hating being tracked by Life360 is completely natural to them.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Stop-Life360-Tracking-vs-Spoofing-Life360"><a href="#Part-3-Stop-Life360-Tracking-vs-Spoofing-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360"></a>Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360</h2><p>To stop or to spoof, that is the question! Yes, when you are annoyed with being tracked by Life360, you can have two options with you. Either you can stop Life360 tracking or spoof Life360 tracking. But what goes best? You might be wondering the same. For many of you, simply stopping the app and logging out from it can be a plain solution. However, we don’t support this. To us, the faking location on Life360 is much better.</p><ul><li>This is because firstly, if you log out and completely stop using the app, your members will get a notification for the same. To this, their curiosity will arise and none of them will stop questioning from you. To avoid this, we suggest spoofing Life360 location and not stopping it.</li><li>Secondly, this may be fun as you can show off to your friends that you are traveling somewhere else. The list of friends may include those who are jealous of you. And this is the best way to double up their jealousy.</li><li>Thirdly, if you tell the actual location of your device every time, many of the members, who are not having good intentions, can trace your routine and anything wrong can happen to you. Spoofing location can be a good way to trick them and catch their intentions.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Fake your Life360 location to any other address you require with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.</p><ul><li>Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone&#x2F;Android.</li><li>Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.</li><li>There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.</p><h3 id="6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings"><a href="#6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings"></a>6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings</h3><p>Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you.

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood.

Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place.

People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt=" dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme 12 Pro 5G to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change "                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-fake-gps-without-root-on-honor-80-pro-straight-screen-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Fake GPS Without Root On Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-tecno-spark-20-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Tecno Spark 20 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-best-route-generator-apps-you-should-try-on-itel-a60s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Itel A60s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-on-realme-narzo-60-5g-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 Methods to Turn off Life 360 On Realme Narzo 60 5G without Anyone Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-apple-iphone-8-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Apple iPhone 8 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-tecno-camon-20-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Tecno Camon 20 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-best-route-generator-apps-you-should-try-on-htc-u23-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On HTC U23 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/6-ways-to-change-spotify-location-on-your-vivo-x-flip-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Vivo X Flip | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-xiaomi-civi-3-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Xiaomi Civi 3?

This has to do with its innovative algorithms and thanks to its user-friendly approach. The process of faking the location involves the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Access Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and Move to Toolbox</strong></p><p>Begin with the launch of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location on your computer and establish a connection with your Android or iOS device. Navigate to the map screen and select the “Teleport Mode” icon, which is situated as the first option in the toolbar near the top-right corner. Now, start the process by tapping the search bar at the top left corner, inputting your desired location, and hitting “Enter.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="select the desired location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Move to the Targeted Location and Verify It</strong></p><p>Upon completion of the initial setup, proceed to teleport to the targeted location by clicking “Move Here” on the map screen. This action prompts the cursor to relocate to the specified location on the map. It also simultaneously adjusts the location of your Android or iOS device. To validate the successful location change, access your smartphone and open a map application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="click the move here button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem"><a href="#Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?"></a>Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?</h2><p>Faking your GPS has its advantages, primarily protecting your privacy.</p><p>However, if you’re on the receiving end of a fake GPS signal, you need to detect any spoofing attempts before it’s too late. You need to have a security measure to ensure data you’re receiving is coming from a legitimate source instead of a malicious one. It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.</p><p>Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.</p><p><strong>Food Delivery</strong></p><p>Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to. They may also gain an unfair advantage to gain priority in order queues and report longer rides to earn more from the platform. In addition, a more egregious issue is couriers charging for deliveries that weren’t made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-03.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing on food delivery driver apps"                ></p><p><strong>Gaming</strong></p><p>Using GPS spoofing in MMORPGs enables gamers to take advantage of faking their position without moving into the comforts of their own home. This can lead to more in-game rewards that are otherwise difficult to achieve without GPS spoofing.</p><p>Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.</p><p><strong>Social Media</strong></p><p>Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.</p><p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p><p>Most financial institutions across the globe use location data to verify users to prevent fraud. Having inaccurate data is a major security beach, especially when handling financial service apps on the internet.</p><p>There are various ways to protect yourself from being on the other end of a fake GPS location. You can easily use specialized apps, including <a class="link"   href="https://apkpure.com/mock-location-root-detector/com.check.mock" >mock location detection APKs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you’re on Android. These anti-spoofing GPS apps help detect if someone is providing fake GPS locations. However, if this is not available to you, there are several ways you can mitigate malicious actors by applying some safeguards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-04.jpg"                      alt="mock location detection apks"                ></p><p>Here are some of the methods you can take advantage of.</p><ul><li>Cross-reference location data from multiple sources to detect fake GPS locations. You can cross reference from GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell tower triangulation to analyze accurate GPS.</li><li>Analyze abnormal patterns in location data presented to you from sudden jumps in location or having unrealistic speeds during movement.</li><li>Verify the accuracy of GPS by comparing location data to known landmarks, including buildings, bridges, or roads.</li><li>Using a dedicated GPS simulator and comparing results to expected from provided data.</li><li>Have a security measure to detect GPS spoofing apps installed on a user’s smartphone.</li></ul><p>While the methods to detect GPS locations are presented above, it’s important to remember that detecting fake GPS locations is difficult and requires you to combine different methods. You can easily detect mock locations on Android, but the methods available if you’re on a different device will vary depending on the resources at your disposal.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Faking your GPS is easy nowadays.

For example, you may touch an icon of a family member to receive instructions to that user’s location on the Life360 website.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-Life360-Always-Accurate"><a href="#Part-3-Is-Life360-Always-Accurate" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?"></a>Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?</h2><p>Previously, Life360 was criticized for being inaccurate, especially when locating people. However, the company has recently updated its system to ensure that the data it collects is accurate.</p><p>The Life360 app uses GPS technology to track your location. When you first install the app, you will be prompted to set up your location. This is done by entering your zip code, city, and state.</p><p>You will also be asked to select a default location. This will be used to determine your home address. Once you enter your zip code, city, and state, you will be able to view your location on a map.</p><p>Also, Life360 works best in urban areas. If you live in an area with many tall buildings, Life360 may not work as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Is-Life360-Safe-for-Your-Privacy"><a href="#Part-4-Is-Life360-Safe-for-Your-Privacy" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?"></a>Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?</h2><p>Life360 is a relatively new app, but it has been getting attention lately. People are wondering whether it is safe for them to use and whether or not it is worth it.</p><p>According to the Life360 website, the app is safe because it is encrypted. The encryption ensures that no one can intercept your communications.</p><p>If you are worried about privacy, you can disable the app’s location tracking feature. You can also disable the feature if you want to be notified whenever someone enters or leaves a particular area.</p><p>You can also use the app without giving anyone else access to your location. You can create a guest profile.</p><p>There are no ads or in-app purchases. You do not have to give any information to Life360. You can use the app without giving any information.</p><p>Life360 is also very easy to use. You do not need to have any special training to use the app. You simply need to sign up and download the app.</p><p>Life360 is available for free on Google Play and Apple App Store.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Can-a-Location-be-faked-on-Life360"><a href="#Part-5-Can-a-Location-be-faked-on-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Can a Location be faked on Life360?"></a>Part 5: Can a Location be faked on Life360?</h2><p>What if You do not want your location to be tracked by someone else? One of the main reasons why people use Life360 is that it allows you to share your location with friends, family, and even strangers. However, if you do not want to be tracked by others, you need to know how to fake your location.</p><p>Unfortunately, you cannot spoof your location through Life360, so it is evident that you have to use another way to ensure that no one will know where you are. The easiest solution is an application called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can help you change your location in real-time.</p><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a comprehensive data management desktop software, which helps you to get all your data in one place and protect your important files from being lost.

After that, run the executable file to begin using the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="access virtual location feature"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After going through all of the available choices, choose “Virtual Location,” and then connect your iPhone or Android phone to your computer. Select “Get Started” from the drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="tap on get started button"                ></p><p>For iPhone users, after the program has been linked via a USB cord, it is possible to connect wirelessly without a connection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="tap on move here button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You may see your current position on a map in the new window. If you are having trouble finding your current position when looking for locations on the map, you may hit the “center on” symbol that is located in the side to the right of the map to reveal your exact location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="choose destination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the matching icon in the top right to enter “teleport mode.” It’s as simple as entering your destination location in the top left corner and clicking on the “go” button. Let’s look at Rome, Italy, as an illustration of this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="choose destination you want"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> It’s clear to the system that Rome is your destination. To relocate, choose “Move Here” from the menu that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="choose destination you want"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now you’re in Rome instead of wherever you were before. Your iOS or Android smartphone will always show Rome, Italy as your location, regardless of where you really are. This is the exact same location that appears in your location-based program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png"                      alt="tap on move here button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-FAQs"><a href="#Part-6-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: FAQs"></a>Part 6: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-What-are-Life360-events"><a href="#1-What-are-Life360-events" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.</p><p>Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select “Virtual Location” given on the first page of the program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select “Get Started”. Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Enable the “teleport mode” by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone’s GPS to in the text box in the map’s left-upper section. Select “Go”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now select “Move here.” And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device. To confirm, open the maps app on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Pro-Tips:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.</li><li>Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-honor-x9b-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Honor X9b?

Even cab services can’t complete a single trip without using maps in this technological age. So GPS has now become an integral part of everyone’s lives. When you download certain apps, you’ll notice that they request location permission. But most smartphone owners are unaware of the location-changing&#x2F;spoofing feature they can enable on their devices. Yes, you read that correctly.</p><p>You can genuinely spoof your device’s location. While spoofing your location, the applications on Your Realme 11 Pro+ will believe you are in your selected location when you are actually in a different area. Isn’t it incredible? With the <strong>top 11 best location changers</strong>, you can easily accomplish this.</p><p>You can use the GPS <strong>location changer app for iPhone and Android</strong> devices to assist you. In addition, specific tools will enable you to use a custom location according to your needs.

Even cab services can’t complete a single trip without using maps in this technological age. So GPS has now become an integral part of everyone’s lives.

But most smartphone owners are unaware of the location-changing&#x2F;spoofing feature they can enable on their devices. Yes, you read that correctly.</p><p>You can genuinely spoof your device’s location. While spoofing your location, the applications on Your Realme 11 Pro will believe you are in your selected location when you are actually in a different area. Isn’t it incredible? With the <strong>top 11 best location changers</strong>, you can easily accomplish this.</p><p>You can use the GPS <strong>location changer app for iPhone and Android</strong> devices to assist you. In addition, specific tools will enable you to use a custom location according to your needs.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Realme 11 Pro keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set.

But as mentioned earlier, there are some Netflix shows that are not available worldwide.</p><p>There are many potential reasons why Netflix shows vary from one region to another. One of them is cultural influence. Of course, Netflix prioritizes the screening of shows that are highly relatable for the target audience. Hence, the content available in certain locations is locally sourced or regionally concentrated. But that’s not all. There are other reasons why Netflix offers different shows in every country.

Do you want to try it? Here’s a short guide on how to change your location on Netflix using Virtual Private Networks.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First and foremost, check the current standing of your Netflix account and make sure it is active.

How to Change Your Netflix Location on Mobile Devices"></a>Part 4. How to Change Your Netflix Location on Mobile Devices</h2><p>The first three tutorials above on how to change your location on Netflix work pretty well on personal computers. Do they work too on mobile devices? Well, you can try and see what’s going to happen. However, a positive result is not a hundred percent guaranteed. Is there any other way? Fortunately, there is. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> can absolutely help you with that. It offers a potent Virtual Location feature capable of simulating GPS movements and modifying your location settings in a snap&#x2F; Don’t sweat it. It’s very easy to get started. Check out the tutorial below on how to change your location on Netflix using Wondershare Dr.Fone.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download Wondershare Dr.Fone for free from its <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>official website. </u></a> Right after, install it on your computer.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Launch the newly installed software on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your smartphone using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions carefully and execute each step properly to ensure the connection between the two devices is stable enough to handle the succeeding procedures.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Access the left-side panel afterward and then click <strong>Toolbox.</strong> On the main dashboard, click <strong>Virtual Location.</strong> Is it your first time using this feature? If so, let Wondershare Dr.Fone download additional resources. Don’t worry. It will only take a few minutes to complete.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the downloading process has concluded, Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location will immediately open on a separate window. From there, hover over to the top-right menu bar and then click <strong>Teleport Mode.</strong> It is the first icon in the row.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="wondershare drfone teleport mode"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> After that, find the search at the top-left corner of your screen and type in your desired location. Choose one from the suggested results. Then, click the <strong>Enter</strong> icon to proceed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search for your preferred location"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The essential details referring to your chosen location will be displayed on your computer screen, along with a map marker. Read the information very well and make sure that it is exactly the place you’re looking for. Once confirmed, click <strong>Move Here.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="location details"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> The location settings on your mobile devices will be immediately changed to your chosen coordinates. Verify that the changes have already been applied by simply checking out your Maps mobile app. It must not show your real current location.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png"                      alt="location settings changed"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Open the Netflix application on your smartphone and then browse through its catalog. Find the restricted content you want to watch and try to stream it on your device. To restore your original location settings, simply close the Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and then restart your device.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Netflix is definitely at the forefront of modern entertainment.

The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.</p><p>As of now, you cannot run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> as it is only available for Android and iOS. <em>Why?</em> Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the <strong><em>Life360 app for Windows</em></strong>. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the <strong><em>Life360 app on Windows</em></strong>.</p><p>So, without wasting another second, let’s dive straight into the guide.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC"><a href="#Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?"></a>Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?</h2><p>First things first; why would anyone want to use a family locator app like Life360 on their PC? Well, the truth is everyone has their own reason to get <strong><em>Life360 for PC</em></strong>. For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.</p><p>In this situation, you can simply run the <strong><em>Life360 app on PC</em></strong>. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.</p><p>Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?"></a>Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?</h2><p>Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.</p><p>The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.</p><p>However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and <strong><em>run the app on a Windows PC</em></strong>. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.</p><p>These methods include:</p><h2 id="Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator"></a>Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator</h2><p>The first and the most convenient way to run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> is to use an Android Emulator. An emulator is basically a software that creates a virtual Android system on your computer. As a result, you’ll be able to run Android apps on your computer.</p><p>While there are dozens of Android emulators, Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and user-friendly option among all. Unlike other emulators, Bluestacks is easy to set up and use.</p><p>Here’s how you can run <strong><em>Life360 on a computer</em></strong> using Bluestacks Android emulator.&#x2F;</p><p>Step 1: Head over to Bluestacks official website and tap the download button.</p><p>Step 2: Open the installer and tap the “download” button. This will initiate the download process on your System.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-1.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 1"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once the installation process completes, Bluestacks will start to boot. Keep in mind that the first boot may take some time, depending on your system configurations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-2.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 2"                ></p><p>Step 4: In the home screen, tap the “Google Play Store” icon. You’ll be asked to sign-in with your Google account. Enter the right credentials and log-in to the Google Play Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-3.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 13"                ></p><p>Step 5: In the top search bar, type-in Life360 and tap the “install” button to download the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-4.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 5"                ></p><p>Step 6: Life360 is now installed on your computer.

For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.</p><p>In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em></strong>. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.</p><p>Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.</p><p>Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 1"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose the “Projecting to this PC” option in the left menu-bar and make sure that “Available Everywhere” is selected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-2.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 2"                ></p><p>Step 4: If you’re running Android Pie or above on your device, scroll down to open notification drawer and select “Smart View” (or “Cast” in some devices). You’ll see your PC listed here. Tap the button to start Android mirroring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-3.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 3"                ></p><p>Step 5: It may take some while for the connection to establish. Once it does, you’ll be able to cast your device screen onto your computer and you’ll be able to run life360 on your system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-4.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 4"                ></p><p>Keep in mind that you’ll still require your device to navigate through the content on your computer.

For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr.Fone Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your Poco X5 (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer. You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg"                      alt="drfone-change-location-pic-7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.</p><p>As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg"                      alt="change-location-registered-pic-10"                ></p><p>It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Poco M6 Pro 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Poco M6 Pro 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Poco M6 Pro 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Poco M6 Pro 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Poco M6 Pro 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Poco M6 Pro 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Poco M6 Pro 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Poco M6 Pro 5G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Poco-M6-Pro-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Poco-M6-Pro-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Poco M6 Pro 5G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Poco M6 Pro 5G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg"                      alt="restart the software"                ></p><h3 id="3-3uTools-reinstallation"><a href="#3-3uTools-reinstallation" class="headerlink" title="3. 3uTools reinstallation"></a>3. 3uTools reinstallation</h3><p>The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation.

Fixed"></a>iSpoofer is not working On Poco M6 Pro 4G? Fixed</h2><p>Pokemon Go is one of the most appreciated games across the world. Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1"                ></p><p>However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?</p><p>You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Does-iSpoofer-Still-Work-Why"><a href="#Part-1-Does-iSpoofer-Still-Work-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?"></a><strong>Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?</strong></h2><p>If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2"                ></p><p>Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.</p><p>One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3"                ></p><p>iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.</p><p>So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4"                ></p><p>There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely"><a href="#Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?"></a><strong>Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?</strong></h2><p>If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.</p><p>If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -</p><p><strong>VPNs</strong> - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5"                ></p><p><strong>Apps on App Store</strong> - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a sure shot at changing your location without any hassle, then the best suggestion would be to use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Changer.

There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2.

Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy. Using the “Privacy Levels” option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg"                      alt="set the privacy levels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using its “Fixed Location” feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the “Marker” on it to change your browser’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg"                      alt="set the fixed location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones"></a>Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones</h2><p>It is not only on computers where you can use Firefox fake location but also on smartphones.

Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg"                      alt="Route Generator App Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?"></a>Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?</h2><p>In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.</p><p>Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try</h2><p>If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:</p><ol><li><strong>Route4Me</strong></li></ol><p>Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices.

The process is quite simple and can be implemented in all the leading versions of Windows (and other operating systems). Though, there could be a slight change in the overall interface of the OS you are using. To set up free VPN PPT, follow these steps:</p><p>1. To start with, launch Control Panel and go to the Network and Sharing Center.</p><p>2. From here, you need to select the “Set up a new connection or network” option to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-2.png"                      alt="free pptp vpn connection"                ></p><p>3. This will launch a new wizard that can be used to setup a PPTP VPN free. Out of all the provided options, select the “Connect to a workplace” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-3.jpg"                      alt="connect to a workplace"                ></p><p>4. On the next window, you would be given an option to either dial directly or use a VPN. Click on the “Use my Internet Connection (VPN)” option to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-4.png"                      alt="Use my Internet Connection "                ></p><p>5. Great! Now, you need to provide information related to the host and server. You can refer the free PPTP VPN list we have provided in the previous section and pick the server (and hostname) of your choice.</p><p>6. As you would proceed to the next window, you need to provide the username and password of the PPTP VPN free you are using. The same can be obtained from our free PPTP VPN list.</p><p>7. In the end, just click on the “Create” button to use your VPN. It will be listed under the available networks.</p><p>8. Sometimes, we have to change Network Settings to make it work.

Go to the Security tab and make sure the type of VPN is listed as PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol). Also, the data encryption option should be “Optional Encryption (Connect even if no encryption)” and the option for “Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)” should be selected for “Allow these protocols”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-6.jpg"                      alt="pptp vpn properties"                ></p><p>10. Furthermore, you can go to the General tab to make sure the server is specified correctly.</p><p>11. Once it is done, you can save these changes and exit the interface. Now, go to the list of available networks and connect to the free PPTP VPN you have created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-7.png"                      alt="connect to free pptp vpn"                ></p><p>That’s it!

For instance, Facebook Messenger now allows users to share their whereabouts in a snap of a finger. Yes. That feature is called Live Location.</p><p>The Live Location feature on Messenger works beyond sending the address or coordinates of your exact location.

Is that helpful? Absolutely yes. It’s indeed a game-changer in today’s already convenient world. Is it highly recommended? With proper handling and adequate caution, Messenger’s Live Location can definitely do more good than harm to the users.</p><p>In this article, we will delve into the highlights and benefits of Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing features.

There is no problem with that. Messenger allows users to search for a specific place, trace it on the map, and share the details. The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? It’s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.</p><p>Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information. Since the details are automatically generated through GPS, you can be sure that it is correct and definite. If you go out and track it down the neighborhood, you can certainly find the location in no time. Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while you’re out and keep yourself safe from any harm.

It is a free application that allows users to track the location of their loved ones with text messages and one-tap directions. However, it cannot see text messages from other messaging apps or other devices.</p><p>Life360 uses real-time GPS data to notify your group members about your location as a location-sharing app. It also tracks driving habits and the user’s safety while on the road. In addition, you don’t have to worry about privacy; people outside your circle can’t view or access your location or texts.

No one, including your circle members, can spy on what you do on your devices, like checking your internet history or reading texts. Although life360 has many tracking features similar to spy apps, it only provides basic location and text tracking under specific conditions. For people who don’t use Life360 for privacy reasons, what can life360 monitor? Can Life360 see your internet history, or can Life360 see who you text? Here is a brief about everything the app can do and monitor on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-do-with-Life360"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-do-with-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you do with Life360?"></a>Part 2: What can you do with Life360?</h2><p>Life360 is a mobile application that provides family security services that you can download and use for free on Android and IOS. Its basic features include location and driving safety tracking as the application runs in the background. In addition, the application notifies group members if someone in the group is not driving responsibly. Users can also pay for premium perks to access more safety and tracking features for the security of their loved ones.</p><p>There are many valuable features in the life360 app, such as device tracking and locator, which allows you to track your stolen or lost devices. It also allows users to track what other circle members like to do, which route they prefer, and which locations they usually visit. Unfortunately, the app only runs when the location services on any device are turned on, and the user permits it to run in the background. It does not work when the Poco C65 device is turned off, or its battery is dead.</p><p>The paid features of life360 notify circle members when you text while driving. Even if the user turns this feature off, it will still show that you are doing something on your phone while driving.</p><p>One of the best features of Life360 is the panic button which allows users to send out mass emergency texts to their circle members with their GPS coordinates if they are in danger.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-Life360-see-your-texts"><a href="#Part-3-Can-Life360-see-your-texts" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can Life360 see your texts?"></a>Part 3: Can Life360 see your texts?</h2><p>Although it uses some tracking features, there are limitations on what the app can or cannot do. If you are wondering can life360 see your texts, then the answer is “No”; the app can only see and track your texts under one condition. As Life360 links group members’ devices, it can read texts sent between members of any group. All circle members get notifications when your app is active. Some applications allow users to view the text on someone’s device, like their spouse or partner, but life360 does not compromise the privacy of its users and only shows limited information without any way of spying on others.</p><p>Now, you know that Life360 cannot see your text message, but what can Life360 see? Here are some of the typical functionalities and data that Life360 can see:</p><p><strong>1. Location:</strong> Life360 can track the real-time location of the Poco C65 devices associated with the app. This includes the ability to view the current whereabouts of family members on a map and track their movements over time.</p><p><strong>2. Geofencing:</strong> The app allows you to set up geofences, which are virtual boundaries around specific areas. Life360 can detect when a family member enters or leaves a geofenced location and send notifications accordingly.</p><p><strong>3. Driving behavior:</strong> Life360 offers features to monitor driving behavior, such as detecting speed, hard braking, and rapid acceleration. It can provide insights into how safely someone is driving and notify other family members of any concerning events.</p><p><strong>4. Crash detection:</strong> Life360 also includes a crash detection feature that uses sensors in the Poco C65 device to detect potential car accidents. In such cases, the app can automatically send alerts to emergency contacts.</p><p><strong>5.

Once you change the country’s location on Google Play manually, the Play Store requires 48 hours to accept this modification. Moreover, you can only change the country’s server location once a year. With VPN, many country servers are unreachable, and some servers can be reached only through a paid version. This makes the process expensive and time taking.</p><p>To avoid these hurdles and chaos, we recommend you to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to fake your location on both Android and iOS devices.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Poco C51 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Poco C51 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Poco C51 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Poco C51 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Poco C51 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Poco C51 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Poco C51 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Poco C51 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Poco-C51-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Poco-C51-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Poco C51 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Poco C51 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-C51-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-C51-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Poco C51 using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Poco C51 using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg"                      alt="location handler cydia"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg"                      alt="teleport-coordination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg"                      alt="manual mode location handle"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg"                      alt="chowchilla location handler"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: The Joystick will appear on the page and you can use it to shift your location to wherever you want.

Please contact your cellular carrier and try again”. This message indicates that your phone is not connected to the internet.</p><p>As a result, your contacts, photos, and messages are not showing. Life360 may be using cellular data instead of Wi-Fi, but it’s not certain. To avoid this, let us read what we should know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-Life360-Location-Wrong"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-Life360-Location-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?"></a>Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?</h2><h3 id="Interference-From-Nearby-Devices-Networks"><a href="#Interference-From-Nearby-Devices-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Interference From Nearby Devices&#x2F;Networks"></a>Interference From Nearby Devices&#x2F;Networks</h3><p>In some cases, Life360 may not be able to determine the location of your device because it is being interfered with by other nearby devices or networks. For example, if you have an iPhone or iPad, it may be using the same cell tower as your Poco C51.</p><p>The Life360 app has to use the closest available cell tower to determine your location. So if another device uses the closest tower, Life360 will use that instead.</p><h3 id="Poor-Signal"><a href="#Poor-Signal" class="headerlink" title="Poor Signal"></a>Poor Signal</h3><p>A poor signal in a particular region, particularly if you’re commuting, is the most common cause of Life360’s incorrect location. When your phone is in a poor signal area, the app will use the internet instead of cellular data to determine the location of your contacts.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the network lines to determine whether or not this is indeed the source of the problem that prevents your Life360 from being found.</p><p>To get more information about how often does life360 update location, read about the Life360: Learn How Everything Works!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-Life360-Shows-Wrong-Location-Issue"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-Life360-Shows-Wrong-Location-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location Issue?"></a>Part 2: How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location Issue?</h2><p>There are several ways to fix the Life360app problems that life360 not updating its location.

If you notice that life360 is displaying the wrong location, you should examine your Internet connection settings to prevent life360 from displaying an inaccurate location.</p><p>Switch off the option that saves power and then turn on the wireless Internet connection.</p><p>You may turn off your smartphone’s power-saving mode by heading to the status bar and selecting the appropriate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_1.jpg"                      alt="review the internet settings"                ></p><p>Please note that this is just for Android users. Also, do not forget to consider that your Android smartphone’s settings may vary from those listed below.</p><p>The “switch off low power mode” option may be found in the “Settings”&gt; “Battery” menu on an iOS device.</p><p>Android users should also follow this procedure if life360 displays an incorrect location. For battery conservation, numerous programs are disabled when the low power state is engaged.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Double-check-Your-Current-Location-in-the-Settings"><a href="#Method-2-Double-check-Your-Current-Location-in-the-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Double-check Your Current Location in the Settings"></a>Method 2: Double-check Your Current Location in the Settings</h3><p>If life360 shows the incorrect location, the smartphone’s location services significantly come into play. The location settings must be activated to prevent the life360 location issue, and the current program must be updated accordingly.</p><p>Scrolling horizontally on the status bar on an Android device is all that is required for consumers to visit the website. Of course, you can also run the software in the background, which may be accomplished in a variety of straightforward but distinct ways based on the Poco C51 device’s model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_2.jpg"                      alt="double-check your current location"                ></p><p>You may access the Background App Refresh function by going to the settings menu on your iOS device and selecting “Settings,” followed by “General,” and then selecting “Background App Refresh.” Next, launch the location services function by navigating to “Settings”&gt; “Privacy”&gt; “location services” and selecting “Location Services” from the drop-down menu.</p><p>After that, touch on the symbol that represents Life360, as shown below; this will take you to a screen where you may change “Allow Location Access” to “Always” and “Enable Precise Location.”</p><h3 id="Method-3-Connecting-One-Device-at-a-Time"><a href="#Method-3-Connecting-One-Device-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time"></a>Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time</h3><p>Only one device may be used to sign in to the Life 360 app at a time. To prevent the life360 false location problem, log out of all other devices and use just one. When many devices are logged into Life 360 simultaneously, the user’s location might be incorrectly determined.</p><p>If you want reliable results, you must be logged in from the same device. If you use numerous devices simultaneously to log in to Life360, it will report incorrect location errors for each one. Therefore, it is possible to get inaccurate data. Use a single device to log into life360 to prevent the issue of a wrong location showing up.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Keep-Your-Location-on-Life360-in-One-Place"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Keep-Your-Location-on-Life360-in-One-Place" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?"></a>Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?</h2><p>Two of the most important and easy ways to keep your location on life360 in one place are:</p><h3 id="1-Stopping-both-Wi-Fi-and-Cellular-Data-Transmissions"><a href="#1-Stopping-both-Wi-Fi-and-Cellular-Data-Transmissions" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition to the fact that you’re unable to use the internet, people in your circle will notice something wrong. In addition, it may not be adequate to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_3.jpg"                      alt="stopping both wi-fi and cellular data transmissions"                ></p><p>Those with an iPhone have the advantage of being able to disable the usage of cellular data directly inside the application’s settings.

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Poco C50 device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy. Using the “Privacy Levels” option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg"                      alt="set the privacy levels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using its “Fixed Location” feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the “Marker” on it to change your browser’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg"                      alt="set the fixed location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones"></a>Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones</h2><p>It is not only on computers where you can use Firefox fake location but also on smartphones.

When your starting point is close to the ending point, a pop-up asks if you want to set up a circle route. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to create a circular path on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png"                      alt="try setting a circle route"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Realistic-Mode-For-One-Stop-Route-and-Multi-Stop-Route"><a href="#Part-2-Realistic-Mode-For-One-Stop-Route-and-Multi-Stop-Route" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)"></a>Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)</h3><p>This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation.

Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/fluctuation-mode.png"                      alt="apply fluctuation mode"                ></p><h3 id="Part-4-Cooldown-Timer-For-Teleport-Mode-and-Jump-Teleport-Mode"><a href="#Part-4-Cooldown-Timer-For-Teleport-Mode-and-Jump-Teleport-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)"></a>Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)</h3><p>While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the <strong>Cooldown Timer</strong> on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png"                      alt="try cooldown timer to avoid bans"                ></p><p>It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the <strong>Auto jump after cooldown</strong> in the <strong>Jump teleport mode</strong> after turning on the Cooldown Timer.</p><p>This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.</p><h3 id="Part-5-Import-Export-GPX-File"><a href="#Part-5-Import-Export-GPX-File" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Import&#x2F;Export GPX File"></a>Part 5: Import&#x2F;Export GPX File</h3><p>You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files.
