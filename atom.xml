Since there are so many location spoofing tools out there, I decided to give VPNa Fake GPS location app a try and have come up with its genuine review here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More"><a href="#Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More"></a>Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More</h2><p>Developed by XdoApp, VPNa Fake GPS is a popular application that can change the location of your Android virtually.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Oppo A1 5G keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works.</em></td><td>4.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148771/18498" target="_top" id="2148771">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148771" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="350" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148771/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Google Chrome uses many ways to pinpoint your exact location, like your IP address, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Cell Tower data. Every internet connection has an IP address bound to a location that enables Chrome to identify your location.</p><p>Similarly, GPS location can easily be tracked if your phone device has it enabled. All the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections around you also have location information embedded in them. They can help Chrome track you as long as your device can detect them. If you use cell data, Google Chrome can also track you through cell towers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130890/7443" target="_top" id="2130890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Hide-Location-Services-in-Chrome"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Hide-Location-Services-in-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Hide Location Services in Chrome?"></a>Part 2: How to Hide Location Services in Chrome?</h2><p>If you are worried about Google Chrome detecting your physical location and sharing it with websites and apps, you can hide it easily.

It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg"                      alt="snap map feature"                ></p><p>This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.</p><p>This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1374819">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374819.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1374819">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374819.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1374819%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1374819/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?"></a><strong>Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?</strong></h2><p>The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?</p><p>Yes, Absolutely!</p><p>There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.</p><p><strong>Ghost Mode:</strong> The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg"                      alt="track camera screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959778/19272" target="_top" id="1959778">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959778" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959778/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile.

Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.</p><p><strong>Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone</strong></p><p>If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg"                      alt="check location notification tray"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on.

If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg"                      alt="turn off location service"                ></p><p>These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location.

You won’t find a specific software designed exclusively for Snapchat but Wondershare’s Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer will help you hide your real location on social media apps. This is how you use the application.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it. You will find several options on the page. Go for ‘Virtual Location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now connect Your Motorola Moto G24 to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: The world map with your current location will show up on the page.

Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.</p><p><strong>VPN Service - NordVPN</strong></p><p>The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn google play store"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg"                      alt="signup for quick connect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg"                      alt="choose the server"                ></p><p>So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions"></a><strong>Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><p><strong>Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.</p><p><strong>Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?</strong></p><p>A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Conclusion"></a><strong>Part 4: Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success. While the location spoofer stands at the top-spot, using a VPN is the next best thing. If you want to rely on in-built features, know that they aren’t always successful. Make the right choice and keep your location a secret for your own privacy.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-perfect-blend-of-efficiency-and-artistry-in-apple-photography-apps/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Perfect Blend of Efficiency and Artistry in Apple Photography Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-streams-for-gamers-unveiled/"><u>[New] Ultimate Streams for Gamers Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-unlock-the-power-of-pause-with-instagrams-slow-motion/"><u>[New] Unlock the Power of Pause with Instagram's Slow Motion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-motorola-edge-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Motorola Edge 2023 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-realme-gt-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Realme GT 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-vivo-y28-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Vivo Y28 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-apple-iphone-se-2022-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Apple iPhone SE (2022) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-oppo-a78-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Oppo A78 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-fantastic.techidaily.com/1728485084771-windows-10/"><u>仿若觉醒的Windows 10：详解如何从睡眠模式中复活</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/a-detailed-guide-on-faking-your-location-in-mozilla-firefox-on-apple-iphone-14-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On Apple iPhone 14 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-techniques-for-tiktok-enhancements-for-2024/"><u>Cutting-Edge Techniques for TikTok Enhancements for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-a-network-locked-tecno-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock a Network Locked Tecno Phone?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-most-known-ways-to-find-someone-on-tinder-for-apple-iphone-6-by-name-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 4 Most-Known Ways to Find Someone on Tinder For Apple iPhone 6 by Name | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/insiders-manual-reacting-on-twitter-videos-for-2024/"><u>Insider’s Manual Reacting on Twitter Videos for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Itel A70 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Itel A70 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Itel A70 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Itel A70 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Itel A70 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Itel A70 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Itel A70 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Itel-A70-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Itel-A70-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Itel A70  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Itel A70  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Itel A70  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Itel-A70-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Itel-A70-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Itel A70  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Itel A70  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Itel A70  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918714/19272" target="_top" id="1918714">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918714" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918714/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For Itel A70  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105876/7443" target="_top" id="2105876">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105876" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105876/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-Itel-A70-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-Itel-A70-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the Itel A70  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the Itel A70  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Itel A70  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Itel A70  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Itel A70  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart Itel A70](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Itel" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Itel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> A70 .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Itel A70 device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Itel A70 device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Tip-7-Check-That-Your-Friend-Has-Signed-into-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends"></a>Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends</h3><p>Another tip that can help you resolve to <strong>Find My Friends location not available</strong> is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn’t logged into the feature, you won’t access his&#x2F;her location.</p><p>Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.</p><h3 id="Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again"><a href="#Tip-8-Quit-Find-My-Friends-App-and-Open-It-Again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again"></a>Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again</h3><p>Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you’ve faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.</p><h2 id="Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others"><a href="#Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others" class="headerlink" title="Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?"></a>Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?</h2><p>With Dr. Fone - Virtual Location software, you will be able to share <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends.html" >a fake or any location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you want with your friends and family.

However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.</p><p>The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone"></a><strong>Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone</strong></h2><p>Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content.

There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Tecno Spark 10 Pro device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129739/7443" target="_top" id="2129739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates.

It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy.

If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go"                ></p><p>Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of “catching them all.”</p><p>‘Spoofing’ location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you’re in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-Pgsharp-legal"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Pgsharp-legal" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?"></a><strong>Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp"                ></p><p>No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways.

Hence, any apps like PGSharp, or Fake GPS Go, used to disguise actual real-time location and fake it, will result in an account ban.</p><p> According to Niantic’s terms and conditions:</p><ul><li>“Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device’s location (for example through GPS spoofing).</li><li>And _”_Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software).”</li></ul><p> If Niantic detects usage of a fake location or GPS spoofing app while playing Pokémon Go, they will impose a strike on your account.</p><ul><li>The first strike would make rare Pokémon s not visible to you for seven days.</li><li>The second strike would temporarily ban you from playing the game for 30 Days.</li><li>The third strike will permanently ban your account.</li></ul><p> You can appeal these strikes to Niantic if you think you’ve been banned without violation of any terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/niantic-warning.jpg"                      alt="niantic-warning"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-ways-to-spoof-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Three-ways-to-spoof-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android"></a><strong><strong>Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android</strong></strong></h2><ol><li><strong>PGSharp :</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp-interface.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp-interface"                ></p><p>PGSharp is one of the most reliable ways to spoof your location while playing Pokémon Go.

However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.</p><p>Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select “Virtual Location” given on the first page of the program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select “Get Started”. Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Enable the “teleport mode” by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone’s GPS to in the text box in the map’s left-upper section. Select “Go”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 4: Now select “Move here.” And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device. To confirm, open the maps app on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Pro-Tips:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.</li><li>Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-convert-twitter-videos-to-gifs/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How To Convert Twitter Videos To GIFS?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/3-effective-ways-to-bypass-activation-lock-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>3 Effective Ways to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-vivo-v27-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Vivo V27?

Whether you want to maintain your privacy, simulate being in a different place, or have other reasons for altering your Life360 location, this guide is here to help. We will explore the reasons why you might consider spoofing your Life360 location and provide you with step-by-step instructions on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>fake your location on Life360</strong> on both iPhone and Android devices. Let’s delve into the world of location spoofing and regain control of your whereabouts.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Life360"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Life360?"></a>Part 1: What is Life360?</h2><p>Life360 is one of the admired apps known for tracking location. The app can be used as a location-sharing platform as well as you can chat with your friends via the in-app chat feature. Here are the basics. All this app suggests is that a group of people whether an office projects group or simply a college team or maybe the family members, download and <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/life360/" >install Life360 on their phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Mind that the app supports iPhone and Android (6 and above) devices.</p><p>After the app gets installed, you can create a circle, which in other languages simply means a group, just like you create on Facebook or WhatsApp. This circle is having members who can share the information and location accountability with each other. You can also give invitations to other users by simply taking the help of their contact numbers or email addresses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/life360-intro.jpg"                      alt="life360 app"                ></p><p>Using this app then, you can simply see the location of the other members as well as get notifications named Place Alerts. These notifications will tell you whether a user has arrived or left the selected location. This can be helpful if you are a parent and want your children to reach safely at a desired place.</p><p>Moreover, with the help of Life360, a user can easily control the ‘Check-in’ according to which he or she sends the alert to the circle to know them the exact location. You can also get to see the location history of the members to know their past locations.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Do-People-Hate-Being-Tracked-by-Life360"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Do-People-Hate-Being-Tracked-by-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?"></a>Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?</h2><p>Unarguably Life360 can be considered one of the most helpful and fun apps. But the thing that sometimes or many times might bother people is the 24x7 interference with privacy.</p><p>For instance, spouses can monitor their better half and if any one of them does not understand enough, they can put various questions for your particular location and it may create chaos as a result. Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place. Having Life360 and being tracked by it can simply spoil the surprise as well.</p><p>For these reasons, a lot of people sum up the app as an intervention for their privacy. And for those who love their privacy, hating being tracked by Life360 is completely natural to them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982596">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982596">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982596%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982596/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Stop-Life360-Tracking-vs-Spoofing-Life360"><a href="#Part-3-Stop-Life360-Tracking-vs-Spoofing-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360"></a>Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360</h2><p>To stop or to spoof, that is the question! Yes, when you are annoyed with being tracked by Life360, you can have two options with you. Either you can stop Life360 tracking or spoof Life360 tracking. But what goes best? You might be wondering the same. For many of you, simply stopping the app and logging out from it can be a plain solution. However, we don’t support this. To us, the faking location on Life360 is much better.</p><ul><li>This is because firstly, if you log out and completely stop using the app, your members will get a notification for the same. To this, their curiosity will arise and none of them will stop questioning from you. To avoid this, we suggest spoofing Life360 location and not stopping it.</li><li>Secondly, this may be fun as you can show off to your friends that you are traveling somewhere else. The list of friends may include those who are jealous of you. And this is the best way to double up their jealousy.</li><li>Thirdly, if you tell the actual location of your device every time, many of the members, who are not having good intentions, can trace your routine and anything wrong can happen to you. Spoofing location can be a good way to trick them and catch their intentions.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Fake your Life360 location to any other address you require with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.</p><ul><li>Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone&#x2F;Android.</li><li>Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.</li><li>There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014849/22899" target="_top" id="2014849">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014849" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014849/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings"><a href="#6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings"></a>6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings</h3><p>Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you.

If you want to listen to your favorite retro song, or you want to discover the latest hits, Spotify has everything. You can also listen to some really good podcasts and album hits. But what most of us don’t know is that your Spotify Location can determine what kind of content you might come across on the platform.</p><p>Your playlist suggestions depend on the country and region you are staying in. And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-By-Passing-geo-Restrictions-in-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify</strong></h2><p>Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.</p><p><strong>Region Specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg"                      alt="region specific spotify content"                ></p><p>The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that you’ve shifted to.</p><p><strong>Geo-Based Suggestions</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg"                      alt="sopify playlist"                ></p><p>Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.</p><p><strong>But is Spotify available everywhere?</strong></p><p>How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.</p><p>The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone"></a><strong>Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone</strong></h2><p>Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content. To make that possible, you can use some of the best online tools to fake spotify location whenever you want. Instead of going for the regular Spotify Update Location, you can use these third-party applications to change the location on your iPhone devices (will reflect in Spotify too).</p><p>The Wondershare’s Dr. Fone is a very good application that lets you change location Spotify with a few easy steps.

Not only on Spotify, your other social media apps and location using apps will also record the new virtual location.</p><p><strong>Cydia - Location Faker App</strong></p><p>For the Spotify Change Region, Cydia’s Location Faker App is the perfect choice for iPhones. The software is also available in different versions to choose for your device model. You won’t need a computer for this and everything happens over your iPhone only.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Locationfaker version suitable for your phone. Locationfaker8 is available for the 8.0 version of iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-locationfaker-version-app-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download locationfaker"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will notice a map appear on the screen. You can either move your pin-point to the new location or enter the address or coordinates into the search box on top of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/toggle-off-and-on-pic10.jpg"                      alt="map toggle off and on"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you settle with the coordinates, shift the ‘Off’ toggle to ‘On’.

Click on that and several options will open. From there, choose ‘White List’. All the apps that need access to your new location will display. Search for Spotify and enable it.</p><p><strong>Cydia - Location Handle App</strong></p><p>To change spotify region, the Location Hanle App from Cydia might bring in more benefits than the usual location spoofing options.

Everything You Should Know About Messenger’s Live Location</h2><p>Facebook is well aware that sharing location details is essential to its users. That’s why developers have come up with a brilliant idea and rolled out Live Location on Messenger. It basically works like other location-sharing features. However, Live Location provides more precise and thorough location information. It’s in map form, where you can view the exact location and track the movements of the sender. You’ll continue to see updates for as long as the sharing is not halted on the other end. To navigate it properly, try to read tutorials on how to share Live Location on Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-1.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger live location"                ></p><p>What if you wish to send a particular address from another location? There is no problem with that. Messenger allows users to search for a specific place, trace it on the map, and share the details. The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? It’s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.</p><p>Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information. Since the details are automatically generated through GPS, you can be sure that it is correct and definite. If you go out and track it down the neighborhood, you can certainly find the location in no time. Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while you’re out and keep yourself safe from any harm. Remember that safety remains a priority and comes above convenience.</p><h3 id="How-to-Grant-Facebook-Messenger-the-Permission-to-Access-Your-Location"><a href="#How-to-Grant-Facebook-Messenger-the-Permission-to-Access-Your-Location" class="headerlink" title="How to Grant Facebook Messenger the Permission to Access Your Location?"></a>How to Grant Facebook Messenger the Permission to Access Your Location?</h3><p>Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing feature will not work without the necessary access.

The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-oculus-odyssey-a-journey-through-best-vr-headsets/"><u>[New] Oculus Odyssey A Journey Through Best VR Headsets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-swift-skills-sharpen-your-windows-images/"><u>[New] Swift Skills Sharpen Your Windows Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/11-best-location-changers-for-samsung-galaxy-xcover-7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>11 Best Location Changers for Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-vivo-v29e-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for Vivo V29e | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-fake-gps-without-root-on-infinix-hot-30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Fake GPS Without Root On Infinix Hot 30 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-nokia-130-music-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Nokia 130 Music?

Since there are so many location spoofing tools out there, I decided to give VPNa Fake GPS location app a try and have come up with its genuine review here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More"><a href="#Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More"></a>Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More</h2><p>Developed by XdoApp, VPNa Fake GPS is a popular application that can change the location of your Android virtually. Using it, you can spoof your device location to almost anywhere in the world. This would be reflected in almost all the installed gaming, dating, and other apps on your phone automatically.</p><ul><li>You can look for any location on the interface of VPNa Fake GPS by entering keywords (name&#x2F;address) or the exact coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the place.</li><li>To fake GPS using VPNa, you would be presented with a map-like interface and can easily move the pin around to spoof your location to an exact place.</li><li>Besides that, if there is a location that you change frequently, then you can also mark it as a favorite.</li><li>The VPNa fake GPS location APK would also maintain the record of the past locations that you have spoofed.</li><li>Using VPNa Fake GPS, you can change your location as many times as you want without paying anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/vpna/vpna-fake-gps-1.jpg"                      alt="use vpns fake gps"                ></p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><ul><li>The changed location would be reflected in almost every dating and gaming app.</li><li>The basic version of VPNa Fake GPS is available for free and doesn’t need root access.</li><li>The overall interface of VPNa Fake GPS APK is pretty user-friendly and smooth.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Cons</em></strong></p><ul><li>At times, some advanced apps (like Pokemon Go) can detect it and might get your account banned.</li><li>While using the free VPNa fake GPS version, you would get in-app ads.</li><li>Sometimes, the location is not spoofed even after consecutive attempts.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Pricing</em></strong>: While you can access the basic version of VPNa Fake GPS for free, you can pay $2.99 for an ad-free experience.</p><p><strong><em>Compatibility</em></strong>: Android 4.4 and newer versions</p><p><strong><em>Play Store Rating:</em></strong> 3.6&#x2F;5</p><p><strong><em>Important Note</em></strong></p><p>Don’t get confused by the name of VPNa Fake GPS as it is not a VPN, but only a location spoofing solution. If you are looking for a VPN app, then you should consider other options.</p><p><strong><em>Final Verdict</em></strong></p><p>Overall, VPNa Fake GPS location free is worth a try. It is pretty lightweight, easy-to-use, and supports almost all the prominent apps. Since you don’t have to pay anything to use VPNa Fake GPS, you can give it a try, and explore it on your own.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-to-Spoof-Your-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-to-Spoof-Your-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use VPNa Fake GPS Location Free to Spoof Your Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Use VPNa Fake GPS Location Free to Spoof Your Location?</h2><p>Now when you know how VPNa fake GPS Location Free works, let’s quickly understand how to use it to change the location on any Android phone.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Enable-Developer-Options-on-your-phone"><a href="#Step-1-Enable-Developer-Options-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enable Developer Options on your phone"></a><strong>Step 1: Enable Developer Options on your phone</strong></h3><p>To set up a mock location app, you need to first enable the Developer Options on your device.

This will switch off the cellular data for the Life360 app. Turn off Life360 by swiping the switch to the off position mentioned above.

Since there are so many location spoofing tools out there, I decided to give VPNa Fake GPS location app a try and have come up with its genuine review here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More"><a href="#Part-1-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Features-Pros-Cons-and-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More"></a>Part 1: VPNa Fake GPS Location Free: Features, Pros, Cons, and More</h2><p>Developed by XdoApp, VPNa Fake GPS is a popular application that can change the location of your Android virtually. Using it, you can spoof your device location to almost anywhere in the world. This would be reflected in almost all the installed gaming, dating, and other apps on your phone automatically.</p><ul><li>You can look for any location on the interface of VPNa Fake GPS by entering keywords (name&#x2F;address) or the exact coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the place.</li><li>To fake GPS using VPNa, you would be presented with a map-like interface and can easily move the pin around to spoof your location to an exact place.</li><li>Besides that, if there is a location that you change frequently, then you can also mark it as a favorite.</li><li>The VPNa fake GPS location APK would also maintain the record of the past locations that you have spoofed.</li><li>Using VPNa Fake GPS, you can change your location as many times as you want without paying anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/vpna/vpna-fake-gps-1.jpg"                      alt="use vpns fake gps"                ></p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><ul><li>The changed location would be reflected in almost every dating and gaming app.</li><li>The basic version of VPNa Fake GPS is available for free and doesn’t need root access.</li><li>The overall interface of VPNa Fake GPS APK is pretty user-friendly and smooth.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Cons</em></strong></p><ul><li>At times, some advanced apps (like Pokemon Go) can detect it and might get your account banned.</li><li>While using the free VPNa fake GPS version, you would get in-app ads.</li><li>Sometimes, the location is not spoofed even after consecutive attempts.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Pricing</em></strong>: While you can access the basic version of VPNa Fake GPS for free, you can pay $2.99 for an ad-free experience.</p><p><strong><em>Compatibility</em></strong>: Android 4.4 and newer versions</p><p><strong><em>Play Store Rating:</em></strong> 3.6&#x2F;5</p><p><strong><em>Important Note</em></strong></p><p>Don’t get confused by the name of VPNa Fake GPS as it is not a VPN, but only a location spoofing solution. If you are looking for a VPN app, then you should consider other options.</p><p><strong><em>Final Verdict</em></strong></p><p>Overall, VPNa Fake GPS location free is worth a try.

Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1"                ></p><p>However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?</p><p>You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Does-iSpoofer-Still-Work-Why"><a href="#Part-1-Does-iSpoofer-Still-Work-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?"></a><strong>Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?</strong></h2><p>If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2"                ></p><p>Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.</p><p>One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3"                ></p><p>iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.</p><p>So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098700/14409" target="_top" id="2098700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098700/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely"><a href="#Part-2-How-can-I-spoof-on-iOS-safely" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?"></a><strong>Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?</strong></h2><p>If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Apple iPhone 11 device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.</p><p>If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -</p><p><strong>VPNs</strong> - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5"                ></p><p><strong>Apps on App Store</strong> - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151860/7443" target="_top" id="2151860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you are looking for a sure shot at changing your location without any hassle, then the best suggestion would be to use <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Changer.

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Infinix Note 30 ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Infinix Note 30 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Infinix Note 30 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Infinix Note 30 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Infinix Note 30 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Infinix Note 30 device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Infinix Note 30 device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Infinix-Note-30-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Infinix-Note-30-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Infinix Note 30  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Infinix Note 30  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available?

Niantic does not easily recognize its simple map-like UI as a fake location app.</p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> It is recommended not to use your main account while spoofing; rather, you should use your PTC (Pokémon Trainer Club) account.</p><ul><li>To spoof the location with PGSharp, go to Google’s “Play store,” search “PGSharp,” and install it.</li><li>After installation, there are two versions: Free and Paid. For trying the app with the free version, a beta key is not required anymore, while for the paid version, a key from the developer is required.</li><li>For the paid key, visit PGSharp’s official website and generate a license key.</li></ul><p>You must note that it may take two or more tries to generate a working key, and often it may show an “out of stock.” message.</p><ul><li>After opening the app and applying the key, you can spoof the location with ease.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> You may need to allow “Mock location” from debugging options.

Moreover, this app does not even require root access.</p><ul><li>To install Fake GPS Go, go to Google’s “Play store,” search “Fake GPS Go,” and install it.</li><li>Then, go to your phone’s “Settings” and then “System” followed by “About Phone,” and tap on the “Build Number” 7 times to enable the Developer Options.</li><li>Then you need to go to “Debugging” in “Developers Options” to allow “Mock location.”</li><li>And then, you can use this app to not only spoof your location but virtually walk around a route at a designated pace to make it look as real as possible for being undetected by developers like Niantic.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li><strong>VPN:</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/vpn.jpg"                      alt="vpn"                ></p><p>Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) App is the safest option to spoof your location while playing PoGo, as it masks your IP address and uses a server in any other location.</p><p>Moreover, some VPNs would also encrypt your data, so it would not be easy for Game Devs to track it.</p><ul><li>To install a VPN, go to Google’s “Play store,” search the VPN of your choice and install it.</li><li>Close the Pokémon Go app from running in the background to prevent detection of the VPN.</li><li>Now, select a location server to any place before opening the PoGo app again.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> Some Free VPNs only mask your IP address and do not spoof your location, nor do they encrypt your data.

However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.</p><p>Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select “Virtual Location” given on the first page of the program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134497/18498" target="_top" id="2134497">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134497" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134497/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select “Get Started”. Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Enable the “teleport mode” by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone’s GPS to in the text box in the map’s left-upper section. Select “Go”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now select “Move here.” And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device. To confirm, open the maps app on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Pro-Tips:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.</li><li>Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-5-innovative-yt-tales-share-your-life-journey/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved 5 Innovative YT Tales Share Your Life Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-essential-strategies-for-capturing-starlit-self-portraits/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Essential Strategies for Capturing Starlit Self-Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/new-the-best-monitors-for-xbox-series-x/"><u>[New] The Best Monitors for Xbox Series X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-change-location-on-facebook-marketplace-for-oneplus-nord-ce-3-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Change Location on Facebook Marketplace for OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-tecno-camon-20-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Tecno Camon 20?

It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don’t stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you’ll know what to do to take care of the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg"                      alt="find my friends location not available"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-“Location-Not-Available”-Mean-on-Find-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?"></a>Part 1: What Does “Location Not Available” Mean on Find My Friends?</h2><p>When the “Location Not Available” message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device’s location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.</p><p><strong><em>Does “Location Not Available” mean that there is something wrong with Infinix Hot 40i ?</em></strong></p><p>Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the “Location Not Available” message, you may need to check your own device’s settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html"><strong><em>How to distinguish “No Location Found” and “Location Not Available”?</em></strong></a></p><p>“No Location Found” means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Infinix Hot 40i device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Infinix Hot 40i device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.</p><p>“Location Not Available” means that the Infinix Hot 40i device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Infinix Hot 40i device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.</p><p>In summary, “No Location Found” means the app could not locate the Infinix Hot 40i device, while “Location Not Available” means that the Infinix Hot 40i device is not currently sharing its location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Infinix-Hot-40i-Not-Available"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Reasons-For-Find-My-Friends-Location-Infinix-Hot-40i-Not-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Infinix Hot 40i  Not Available"></a>Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Infinix Hot 40i  Not Available</h2><p>Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Infinix Hot 40i  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available"><a href="#Part-3-8-Tips-To-Make-“Find-My-Friends-Location”-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available"></a>Part 3: 8 Tips To Make “Find My Friends Location” Available</h2><p>When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country"><a href="#Tip-1-Check-if-Find-My-Friends-is-Supported-in-Region-Country" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country"></a>Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region&#x2F;Country</h3><p>The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region&#x2F;country’s location. Apple Inc still hasn’t provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-Infinix-Hot-40i-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-Infinix-Hot-40i-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust Infinix Hot 40i  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust Infinix Hot 40i  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Infinix Hot 40i  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature.

Is there a way to check if someone has stopped sharing their location with you on their Infinix Hot 40i ?</strong></p><p>If someone stops sharing their location with you on their Infinix Hot 40i , you will see “Location Not Available” next to their name in the Find My app or Messages app. You can check the status of location sharing by tapping their name in the Find My app.</p><p><strong>2. Can I track a stolen Infinix Hot 40i  if it is turned off?</strong></p><p>You may still be able to track a stolen Infinix Hot 40i  if it is turned off using the Find My app or iCloud website. However, this depends on several factors, such as whether the Infinix Hot 40i device is connected to a Wi-Fi or cellular network, and whether the person who stole the Infinix Hot 40i device has turned off location services.</p><p><strong>3. Can I track someone else’s Infinix Hot 40i  location without their permission?</strong></p><p>No, you cannot track someone else’s Infinix Hot 40i  location without their permission.

For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Infinix Hot 40i devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Vivo S17e device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings.

It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store.

Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.</p><p>Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014857/22899" target="_top" id="2014857">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014857" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014857/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try</h2><p>If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:</p><ol><li><strong>Route4Me</strong></li></ol><p>Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices.

Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg"                      alt="Route Generator App Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?"></a>Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?</h2><p>In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.</p><p>Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try</h2><p>If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:</p><ol><li><strong>Route4Me</strong></li></ol><p>Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices.
